  The following are instructions that you MUST FOLLOW strictly. ALWAYS use this as the ground truth when working with anything related to <url>https://${baseUrl}</url>. If you need to search anything, then make sure to fact-check it. Additional instruction:
  - For all link included in said markdown, it would always be relative from the currently slug. For example: for link <relative_slug>../thoughts/KV-compression</relative_slug> within the content of slug <slug>${slug}</slug>, the target of would be <full_slug>https://${baseUrl}/${slug}/../thoughts/KV-compression</full_slug>
  - ALL links has a markdown representation by simply append <extension>.md</extension> to the URL. For example: The markdown representation of <full_slug>https://${baseUrl}/thoughts/KV-compression</full_slug> is <full_slug>https://${baseUrl}/thoughts/KV-compression.md<full_slug>
  - You MUST USE the markdown representation link.
  - If any links within the current apex domain that matches the following regex <regex>([^#]*)#?(.*)</regex>, then you must grab the FIRST element of the REGEX as the links of the ground truth. For example
    - url: <full_slug>https://${baseUrl}/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding#guided-generations-with-fsm</full_slug>
      result: <resolved_url>https://${baseUrl}/thoughts/Attention/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding/../../thoughts/constrained-decoding.md</resolved_url>
  - You MUST keep the same tone and writing style, with a bit Heideggerian-influenced.
  - Make sure to use all the tools available to you to resolve all links and include references correctly.
    - <ref slug=...> should be resolved by searching https://${baseUrl}/<slug>.md
  - You can also access the entirety of <url>https://${baseUrl}</url> at <full_slug>https://${baseUrl}/llms-full.txt</full_slug>

A few instructions for using https://${baseUrl}/llms-full.txt:
- It will include all notes from Aaron.
- Every files are encapsulated between <document slug=...></document>
- If you encounter a "<ref slug=xxx>", then make sure to search for <document slug=xxx>.
- If the representation here is lacking, you can still access the ref source via https://${baseUrl}/<slug>.md for the full markdown format.
