# Academic Paper

Fetch, organize, and create notes for academic papers with proper citations.

## When to Use

- User provides an arXiv URL or ID
- User wants to add a paper to the digital garden
- User requests to create reading notes for a paper
- User needs to organize academic papers and citations
- User wants to link papers with proper bibliography entries

## Instructions

### Complete Academic Paper Workflow

This skill combines citation management, file organization, and note creation into a cohesive workflow.

### Step 1: Extract Paper Information

From arXiv URL/ID:
```
Examples:
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00001
- https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00001.pdf
- arxiv:2301.00001
- 2301.00001

Extract ID: 2301.00001
```

### Step 2: Fetch BibTeX Entry

```bash
curl https://arxiv.org/bibtex/2301.00001
```

Parse the returned BibTeX to extract:
- Citation key (e.g., `author2023title`)
- Title
- Authors
- Year
- Abstract URL
- Categories/tags

### Step 3: Add to References.bib

1. Read `content/References.bib`
2. Check for duplicates (by key, DOI, or eprint)
3. Append new BibTeX entry
4. Run `pnpm format` to organize and validate

### Step 4: Download PDF (Optional)

If user wants to keep the PDF:

```bash
# Download to content/thoughts/papers/
curl -L https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.00001.pdf -o content/thoughts/papers/2301.00001.pdf
```

Naming convention: `<arxiv-id>.pdf`

### Step 5: Create Reading Notes

Generate a markdown file in `content/thoughts/papers/` or `content/thoughts/`:

**Frontmatter template:**
```yaml
---
id: <citation-key>
title: <paper-title>
date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
tags:
  - paper
  - <domain-tags>
  - reading
description: <brief-summary>
authors:
  - <author1>
  - <author2>
arxiv: "<arxiv-id>"
---
```

**Content template:**
```markdown
## summary

Brief summary of the paper [@citation-key].

## key contributions

- Contribution 1
- Contribution 2
- Contribution 3

## methodology

Description of methods used...

## results

Key findings...

## thoughts

Personal reflections and connections to other work...

## related work

- [[thoughts/related-paper-1]]
- [[thoughts/related-paper-2]]

## citations

Full citation: [@citation-key]
```

### Step 6: Link to Existing Content (Optional)

If the paper relates to existing notes:
1. Search for relevant notes in `content/thoughts/`
2. Suggest adding wikilinks or citations
3. Update related notes with cross-references

## Examples

### Example 1: Full Workflow - ArXiv Paper

```
User: Add the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762 to my notes

Steps:
1. Extract ID: 1706.03762
2. Fetch BibTeX: curl https://arxiv.org/bibtex/1706.03762
3. Parse:
   - Key: vaswani2017attention
   - Title: Attention is All You Need
   - Authors: Vaswani et al.
   - Year: 2017
4. Add to References.bib
5. Run: pnpm format
6. Ask user: "Would you like me to download the PDF and create reading notes?"

If yes:
7. Download: curl -L https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf -o content/thoughts/papers/1706.03762.pdf
8. Create: content/thoughts/attention-is-all-you-need.md
   With frontmatter and structure
9. Respond: "Created reading notes at content/thoughts/attention-is-all-you-need.md.
   Use [@vaswani2017attention] to cite this paper."
```

### Example 2: Quick Citation Only

```
User: Just add arxiv:2301.00001 to my bibliography

Steps:
1. Fetch BibTeX: curl https://arxiv.org/bibtex/2301.00001
2. Add to References.bib
3. Run: pnpm format
4. Respond: "Added citation with key 'author2023title'. Use [@author2023title] to cite."
```

### Example 3: Create Notes for Existing Citation

```
User: Create reading notes for the attention paper in my bibliography

Steps:
1. Search References.bib for "attention"
2. Find: vaswani2017attention
3. Extract metadata from BibTeX entry
4. Create: content/thoughts/attention-is-all-you-need.md
5. Populate with template and metadata
6. Respond: "Created reading notes. The paper can be cited with [@vaswani2017attention]."
```

### Example 4: Link Papers to Existing Notes

```
User: Add the transformer paper to my notes on neural networks

Steps:
1. Add paper following steps 1-5
2. Read content/thoughts/neural-networks.md
3. Find appropriate location to add reference
4. Add wikilink or citation
5. Update neural-networks.md with:
   "Recent work on transformers [@vaswani2017attention] shows that..."
6. Respond with changes made
```

## Notes

### File Organization

**Papers:**
- PDFs: `content/thoughts/papers/<arxiv-id>.pdf`
- Notes: `content/thoughts/<descriptive-name>.md` or `content/thoughts/papers/<descriptive-name>.md`

**Bibliography:**
- Single file: `content/References.bib`
- Automatically formatted by `pnpm format`
- Sorted by: type, year, eprint
- Duplicates handled automatically

### Citation Key Conventions

ArXiv papers typically use:
- `<first-author><year><keyword>` (e.g., `vaswani2017attention`)
- Automatically generated by arXiv BibTeX endpoint
- Sometimes includes `arxiv` prefix or eprint number

Always confirm the key after adding to References.bib.

### Tags for Academic Papers

Common tags to use:
- `paper` (always include)
- Domain: `machine-learning`, `nlp`, `computer-vision`, etc.
- Type: `reading`, `reference`, `implementation`
- Status: `to-read`, `reading`, `completed`
- Topics: specific concepts from the paper

### Integration with Other Skills

**Use `citation-manager` for:**
- Adding citations from DOI or other sources
- Validating References.bib
- Managing bibliography

**Use `content-creator` for:**
- Proper markdown formatting
- Adding callouts, sidenotes, math equations
- Linking between notes

### Advanced Features

**Extracting metadata:**
- Some papers include additional metadata in BibTeX
- Categories, DOI, journal information
- Can be used for enhanced frontmatter

**Automatic summarization:**
- If available, use arXiv abstract
- Extract from PDF first page
- User can refine later

**Cross-referencing:**
- Link papers that cite each other
- Create relationship maps
- Build knowledge graphs

### arXiv Specific Features

**arXiv ID formats:**
- Old: `cs/0123456` (category/number)
- New: `2301.00001` (YYMM.NNNNN)
- Both work with arXiv API

**arXiv categories:**
- cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CL (Computer Science)
- stat.ML (Statistics)
- math.XX (Mathematics)
- Use as tags in frontmatter

**arXiv URLs:**
- Abstract: `https://arxiv.org/abs/<id>`
- PDF: `https://arxiv.org/pdf/<id>.pdf`
- BibTeX: `https://arxiv.org/bibtex/<id>`
- Source: `https://arxiv.org/e-print/<id>`
