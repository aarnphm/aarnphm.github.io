# Content Creator

Create properly formatted markdown notes that follow the digital garden's conventions.

## When to Use

- User requests to create a new note or markdown file
- User wants to add formatted content (callouts, sidenotes, math equations)
- User needs help with proper wikilink syntax
- User wants to ensure content follows the style guide

## Instructions

### Creating a New Note

1. Determine the appropriate location under `content/`:
   - Thoughts/essays: `content/thoughts/`
   - Lectures: `content/lectures/`
   - Special projects: `content/hinterland/`
   - Other content types based on context

2. Create frontmatter with required fields:
   ```yaml
   ---
   id: <unique-identifier>
   title: <note-title>
   date: "<YYYY-MM-DD>"
   modified: <auto-generated>
   tags:
     - <tag1>
     - <tag2>
   description: <brief description>
   ---
   ```

3. Apply formatting conventions:
   - All headings in lowercase
   - Use wikilinks for internal references: `[[path/to/note|Display Text]]`
   - Paths are absolute from `content/`

### Adding Callouts

Use Obsidian-style callouts:

```markdown
> [!important] Callout Title
> Content of the callout goes here.
> Can span multiple lines.

> [!note] Another callout type
> More content
```

Common callout types: `note`, `important`, `warning`, `tip`, `example`, `quote`

### Adding Sidenotes

Use the custom sidenotes syntax:

```markdown
Main text content {{sidenotes[label-name]: This is a sidenote that provides additional context}}
```

Example from `content/thoughts/love.md:58`:
```markdown
...to give your full, continuously {{sidenotes[love-nb]: Nb. this is different from attachment theory...}}
```

### Adding Math Equations

**Inline math:**
```markdown
This is inline math: $E = mc^2$
```

**Block math:**
```markdown
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$
```

Use LaTeX syntax compatible with KaTeX.

### Adding Citations

Reference entries from `content/References.bib`:

```markdown
Recent work [@vaswani2017attention] shows that attention mechanisms...

Multiple citations [@author2020; @another2021] demonstrate...

With page numbers [@smith2019, p. 42]
```

### Internal Links

**Wikilinks (preferred):**
```markdown
See [[thoughts/Attention]] for more details.
With custom text: [[thoughts/Attention|attention mechanisms]]
```

**Absolute paths from content/:**
```markdown
[Link text](thoughts/Attention.md)
```

### Embedded Content

Embed other notes:
```markdown
![[thoughts/another-note]]
```

Embed specific sections:
```markdown
![[thoughts/another-note#section-heading]]
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Create Academic Note

```markdown
---
id: transformers
title: attention is all you need
date: "2025-01-15"
tags:
  - machine-learning
  - nlp
  - transformers
description: notes on the transformer architecture
---

## introduction

The transformer architecture [@vaswani2017attention] revolutionized natural language processing {{sidenotes[rnn-comparison]: Previous approaches relied heavily on RNNs and LSTMs}}.

### self-attention mechanism

The core innovation is the self-attention mechanism, defined as:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

> [!important] Key Insight
> Self-attention allows the model to attend to all positions simultaneously.

For more on attention mechanisms, see [[thoughts/Attention]].
```

### Example 2: Add Sidenote to Existing Content

```markdown
Before:
The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

After:
The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks {{sidenotes[benchmarks]: Specifically WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks}}.
```

### Example 3: Add Callout Block

```markdown
> [!warning] Implementation Note
> Make sure to scale the attention scores by $\sqrt{d_k}$ to prevent
> the softmax function from having extremely small gradients.
```

## Notes

- Always use lowercase for headings (enforced by style guide)
- Wikilinks are resolved relative to `content/` directory
- The site uses Obsidian-flavored markdown with custom extensions
- Math rendering uses KaTeX with `throwOnError: true` (syntax must be valid)
- Sidenotes are a custom plugin - use the exact syntax shown
- When in doubt about formatting, check existing files in `content/thoughts/`
