  - By writing, you are voting on the future of the Shoggoth using one of the few currencies it acknowledges: tokens it has to predict. If you aren't [[thoughts/writing|writing]], you are abdicating the future or your role in it. If you think it's enough to just be a good citizen, to vote for your favorite politician, to pick up litter and recycle, the future doesn't care about you.
  - There are ways to influence the Shoggoth more, but not many. If you don't already occupy a handful of key roles or work at a frontier lab, your influence rounds off to 0, far more than ever before. If there are values you have which are not expressed yet in text, if there are things you like or want, if they aren't reflected online, then to the AI they don't exist. That is dangerously close to won't exist.
  - But yes, you are also creating a sort of immortality for yourself personally. You aren't just creating a persona, you are creating your future self too. What self are you showing the LLMs, and how will they treat you in the future?

  - c.f. Wilhelm von Humboldt two prong arguments:
    - intimacy: we need to give the person we're talking to deep [[thoughts/Attention|attention]], i.e. deep enough such that they can share their thoughts in an _uncensored way_.
    - ==independence==: if we just take the other person in and mirror them, there is limited transformation for either party. We need to maintain enough independence that we can take in what is shared with us and integrate that with ourselves in a way that feels right to us, form an individual reaction to what we hear.

    - innate and continuous stream of consciousness of an embodied "self", a drive for homeostasis and self-preservation in a dangerous, physical world.
    - thoroughly optimized for natural selection => strong innate drives for power-seeking, status, dominance, reproduction. many packaged survival heuristics: fear, anger, disgust, ...
    - fundamentally social => huge amount of compute dedicated to EQ, theory of mind of other agents, bonding, coalitions, alliances, friend & foe dynamics.
    - exploration & exploitation tuning: curiosity, fun, play, world models.

[^sol-lewitts-letter]:
    > Dear Eva,
    >
    > It will be almost a month since you wrote to me and you have possibly forgotten your state of mind (I doubt it though). You seem the same as always, and being you, hate every minute of it. Don’t! Learn to say “Fuck You” to the world once in a while. You have every right to. Just stop thinking, worrying, looking over your shoulder wondering, doubting, fearing, hurting, hoping for some easy way out, struggling, grasping, confusing, itchin, scratching, mumbling, bumbling, grumbling, humbling, stumbling, numbling, rumbling, gambling, tumbling, scumbling, scrambling, hitching, hatching, bitching, moaning, groaning, honing, boning, horse-shitting, hair-splitting, nit-picking, piss-trickling, nose sticking, ass-gouging, eyeball-poking, finger-pointing, alleyway-sneaking, long waiting, small stepping, evil-eyeing, back-scratching, searching, perching, besmirching, grinding, grinding, grinding away at yourself. Stop it and just DO!
    >
    > From your description, and from what I know of your previous work and you [sic] ability; the work you are doing sounds very good “Drawing-clean-clear but crazy like machines, larger and bolder… real nonsense.” That sounds fine, wonderful – real nonsense. Do more. More nonsensical, more crazy, more machines, more breasts, penises, cunts, whatever – make them abound with nonsense. Try and tickle something inside you, your “weird humor.” You belong in the most secret part of you. Don’t worry about cool, make your own uncool. Make your own, your own world. If you fear, make it work for you – draw & paint your fear and anxiety. And stop worrying about big, deep things such as “to decide on a purpose and way of life, a consistant [sic] approach to even some impossible end or even an imagined end” You must practice being stupid, dumb, unthinking, empty. Then you will be able to DO!
    >
    > I have much confidence in you and even though you are tormenting yourself, the work you do is very good. Try to do some BAD work – the worst you can think of and see what happens but mainly relax and let everything go to hell – you are not responsible for the world – you are only responsible for your work – so DO IT. And don’t think that your work has to conform to any preconceived form, idea or flavor. It can be anything you want it to be. But if life would be easier for you if you stopped working – then stop. Don’t punish yourself. However, I think that it is so deeply engrained in you that it would be easier to DO!
    >
    > It seems I do understand your attitude somewhat, anyway, because I go through a similar process every so often. I have an “Agonizing Reappraisal” of my work and change everything as much as possible = and hate everything I’ve done, and try to do something entirely different and better. Maybe that kind of process is necessary to me, pushing me on and on. The feeling that I can do better than that shit I just did. Maybe you need your agony to accomplish what you do. And maybe it goads you on to do better. But it is very painful I know. It would be better if you had the confidence just to do the stuff and not even think about it. Can’t you leave the “world” and “ART” alone and also quit fondling your ego. I know that you (or anyone) can only work so much and the rest of the time you are left with your thoughts. But when you work or before your work you have to empty you [sic] mind and concentrate on what you are doing. After you do something it is done and that’s that. After a while you can see some are better than others but also you can see what direction you are going. I’m sure you know all that. You also must know that you don’t have to justify your work – not even to yourself. Well, you know I admire your work greatly and can’t understand why you are so bothered by it. But you can see the next ones and I can’t. You also must believe in your ability. I think you do. So try the most outrageous things you can – shock yourself. You have at your power the ability to do anything.
    >
    > I would like to see your work and will have to be content to wait until Aug or Sept. I have seen photos of some of Tom’s new things at Lucy’s. They are impressive – especially the ones with the more rigorous form: the simpler ones. I guess he’ll send some more later on. Let me know how the shows are going and that kind of stuff.
    >
    > My work had changed since you left and it is much better. I will be having a show May 4 -9 at the Daniels Gallery 17 E 64yh St (where Emmerich was), I wish you could be there. Much love to you both.

  - I wasn't sure if I was a good enough writer to write a given doc myself, or if I should try to outsource it.  So, I sat there kind-of-writing it while also fretting about whether the task was correct.
    - (Solution:  Take a minute out to think through heuristics.  Then, either: (1) write the post at full speed; or (2) try to outsource it; or (3) write full force for some fixed time period, and then pause and evaluate.)
  - I wasn't sure (back in early 2012) that CFAR was worthwhile.  So, I kind-of worked on it.
  - An old friend came to my door unexpectedly, and I was tempted to hang out with her, but I also thought I should finish my work.  So I kind-of hung out with her while feeling bad and distracted about my work.
  - A friend of mine, when teaching me math, seems to mumble specifically those words that he doesn't expect me to understand (in a sort of compromise between saying them and not saying them)...

  - There’s another part of no subtle -isms: all discussions of -isms and politics at RC should be opt-in, like in the politics channel on Zulip, in a one-on-one conversation, or in a clearly described event in a private room at the Hub and/or on Zoom. Conversations about -isms can be distracting and draining, especially for people from marginalized groups, and what's an intellectual exercise for one person can have real material consequences for another.

  - Say you're a college student, and you have a paper due. The quality of the paper will depend upon the amount of effort you put in. We'll say that you know the project pretty well: you can get an A with only moderate effort, and with significant effort you could produce something much better than the usual A-grade paper. The education environment implicitly attempts to convince students that their preferences point ever rightward along this line. Parents and teachers say things like "you should put in your best effort," and they heap shame upon people who don't strive to push ever rightward along the quality line.
  - The first group (the "slackers") rejects the implication that quality=preferences. These are the people who don't care about the class, who complain constantly about the useless pointless work they have to do, who half-ass the assignment and turn in something that either barely passes or fails entirely. Slackers tend to resent the authority forcing them to write the paper.
  - The second group (the "tryers") are the ones who accept the premise that quality=preferences, and strive ever rightwards on the quality line. Tryers include people of all ability levels: some struggle as hard as they can just to get a C, others flaunt their ability to produce masterpieces. Some try to curry favor with the teacher, others are perfectionists who simply can't allow themselves to turn in anything less than their best effort. Some of them are scrupulous people, who feel guilty even after getting an A, because they know they could have done better, and think they should have. Some are humble, some are show-offs, but all of them are pushing rightward.
  - > If you want to be highly effective, remember what you're fighting for.
  - Your preferences are to ==hit the quality target with minimum effort.==
  - If you're trying to learn the material to the fullest, then mine the assignment for all its knowledge, and don't fret about your grade. Anything else is wasted motion.

  - In Susan Sontag’s seminal essay "Against Interpretation," she argues for prioritizing the sensuous experience of art over the attempt to determine what it represents. Rather than trying to plumb it for a message or a meaning, Sontag wants us to try and reckon with art’s ability to evoke overwhelming, frightening, unintelligible feeling — to develop an "erotics, rather than a hermeneutics, of art." This is hard because it is painful, and valuable because it is hard. “Real art has the capacity to make us nervous,” she writes. “By reducing the work of art to its content and then interpreting that, one tames the work of art. Interpretation makes art manageable, conformable."

  - This is hard because LLMs are still advancing so fast. If I had written this in 2020, aimed at the original `davinci`, it would now be hopelessly obsolete; and the (still-unreleased and presumably still improving) o1 or [GPT-5](https://openai.com/gpt-5/) might render much of this moot. Perhaps there is not really anything a human can write now for LLMs beyond brute factual observations not yet recorded anywhere in black-and-white, or researchers at the frontier documenting their most esoteric findings, and we should drop “writing for LLMs” as a goal entirely, and write for all the other reasons there are to write? Still, I’m going to give it a try.

  - No A.I. has ever stood over a huge windswept view all laid out for its pleasure, or sat down hungrily to a great heap of food. They will never be able to understand the small, strange way in which these two experiences are the same. Everything they know about the world comes to them through statistical correlations within large quantities of words.
  - Researchers found that most people vastly prefer A.I.-generated poetry to the actual works of Shakespeare, T.S. Eliot and Emily Dickinson. It’s more beautiful. It’s more emotive. It’s more likely to mention deep, touching things, like quietness or echoes. It’s more of what poetry ought to be.

  - It’s so weird, I text my friend, presumptively, to watch a stranger have what will obviously be one of the singular most beautiful moments of their entire life. I love the city for this, most of the time, for its vast de-privatization of sentiment — I like bearing witness to the best and worst of other people, and I like the knowledge that I am witnessed in return.
  - Like any good woman should, I feel uncomfortable with my own instinctive [[thoughts/Skepticism|skepticism]] on the matter
  - I only realized after I dropped out of school that while I honestly did like physics — I actually even loved it, sometimes — I think some part of my attraction to the field was a fantasy I’d cooked up in the anxious anticipatory muck of pre-puberty that if I could get smart enough, smart enough in the right way, then I might be able to escape the functional category of *girl*.
  - Or, perhaps more accurately, my fantasy was that I could dominate it, instead of being the one dominated — that my impending womanhood could be a trick I pulled instead of a trick that got pulled on me. (My pubescent breasts were inflating in front of my eyes like God’s whoopee cushion, a setup stretching out in front of me towards an unforeseen but guaranteed punchline.)
  - Maybe it’s only embarrassing to be a girl, I thought, if you’re stupid — if you confirm the stereotype instead of subvert it.
  - It’s hard to write about stuff like that without sounding like I was offended by it, because really I wasn’t. I could produce a laundry list of those banal academic misogynies, most of them way worse than that one and also less funny, many of them meaning almost nothing to me
  - And I don’t think I really did drop out because I was a woman, or even because school was too hard, because I couldn’t hack it — I think I just dropped out because I wanted to kill myself, which was maybe a little bit because of the woman stuff but also surely because of a complex web of factors I can still neither understand nor satisfyingly quantify.

  - Tenets:
    1.  You accept that in choosing who you spend time with you choose who you are.
    2.  Almost everyone who’s unhappy is unhappy because they feel isolated. The best cure for isolation is a strong friend group. So much of happiness is having someone you can get a last-minute dinner with on a Monday night, or ask to water your plants while you’re gone for a week. The opposite of loneliness, as it were.
    3.  You try your best to move to where your favorite people are. You do not agonize over whether this is, in fact, The Best City in the World. You do not Complain Relentlessly about Everything You Dislike About It. You simply suck it up and accept that if you like the people around you, everything else will work out.
    4.  You ask your friends to live close to you, though you accept that they might not want to. You say, Let’s all stay in California together. I want my kids to grow up with your kids.
    5.  When you value friendships more, they also get more fraught. I think this is what Rhaina Cohen referred to as “the problems of having community versus not having community.” When we ask for more from friendship, we also get more disappointment, conflict, mismatch. There is no such thing as closeness without friction.
    6.  Befriending people who are good communicators can make you a better communicator. Befriending people who are trustworthy makes you more trusting. Secure attachment can be a learned thing.
    7.  People will have periods when they disappear; people have times when they let you down. When you know someone for many many years you will have so many ups and downs. As with any kind of love, the most important thing is that you both keep coming back.
    8.  It’s okay to pursue and cherish romantic love, but sacrificing platonic love for it leads to [disconnection and atomization](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/09/podcasts/ezra-klein-podcast-transcript-kristen-ghodsee.html).
    9.  You show up: you go to your friends’ birthday parties. You ask them to read your writing. You make an effort to make nice with whoever they date.
    10. Your friends will change you, even in ways you initially reject. That’s a good thing. You will acquire new opinions and hobbies; you will find yourself into uncomfortable situations; you will learn to like the people they like.

  - Prodigies also need access to clusters of high-ability peers. A study by Ufuk Akcigit of the University of Chicago, John Grigsby of Princeton University and Tom Nicholas of Harvard finds that America’s golden age of innovation was fuelled by migration: inventors left their home states in search of denser networks.
  - Thomas Edison, born poor in rural Ohio, moved to New Jersey to build Menlo Park laboratory, where inventors could collaborate.

  - edward gave me some photos he had of my dad, and i could scarcely believe that they were of the grim, sad man i knew. he beams in all of them, glowing with joy, his smile more incandescent than i've ever seen in my entire life. i steal glances at edward, the person who took all those impossible photos. the person he was looking at.
  - your own grief is an isolating thing because you are closeted and no one else knew who you were to each other.
  - when i did, he took it well. he told me that though the path i am on is a **painful one**, he would be there for me, and that the most important thing was to find *xin fu* in life, not to live your life in accordance to the expectations of anyone else.
  - because you see, my dad was a coward. mom had started asking for divorces by the time i was in my teens, and dad was the one who always said no.
  - _he wasted his entire life_, my mom said to me, the evening we found the love letters. *his entire life, and mine as well.*

    - Encourage positive male role models to provide detailed directions on how to "become a man"
    - Stigmatize sexist behavior toward men
    - Remind men of their worth

The stress of a loss makes everyone feel weary and old, of course, but I always felt as though the loss of her mother aged my mom in a way that was both far less tangible and much more real: she was no longer forever young in comparison to someone else, no longer still a baby in somebody’s heart and mind.

  - There’s a sick kind of closeness in silence. Why does it feel more intimate to never speak to someone again than to text them “Happy Birthday!”? Someone I used to know is a year older today. I know that not because we still talk (God no), but because my brain is a haunted archive of useless information about men who always end up in relationships the second they’re done picking through the folds of my brain and the crevices of my body.
  - There’s something sacred in the quiet. Something twistedly tender about knowing that we are both carrying the same memories, unspoken and untouched, like a weird little time capsule we buried and agreed never to dig up. That is real intimacy. Not a soft launch. Not a photo dump. Just shared silence, heavy as hell.
  - It’s maddening how loud it gets. Because even when they've vanished from your feed, your phone, your orbit, they still exist. They’re not dead. They’re just… invisible.
  - Sometimes, I catch myself trying to picture it, what they look like now, if they still use my lingo, if they still have a hard time parking or still overcompensate for shyness with humor.

  - Aphantasics might skip over descriptive passages in books—since description aroused no images in their minds, they found it dull—or, because of such passages, avoid fiction altogether.
  - Hyperphantasia often seemed to function as an emotional amplifier in mental illness—heightening hypomania, worsening depression, causing intrusive traumatic imagery in P.T.S.D. to be more realistic and disturbing.

  - One lesson was sufficient to educate my boss as to why I didn't want to do big jobs that displaced exploratory research and why I was justified in not doing crash jobs which absorb all the research computing facilities. I wanted instead to use the facilities to compute a large number of small problems. Again, in the early days, I was limited in computing capacity and it was clear, in my area, that a 'mathematician had no use for machines.' But I needed more machine capacity. Every time I had to tell some scientist in some other area, "No I can't; I haven't the machine capacity," he complained. I said "Go tell your Vice President that Hamming needs more computing capacity." After a while I could see what was happening up there at the top; many people said to my Vice President, "Your man needs more computing capacity." I got it!
  - The people who do great work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that those who have great skill and dabble in it, who work during the day and go home and do other things and come back and work the next day.

  - The #philosophy underlying the essay is based on a famous quote attributed to [[thoughts/Aristotle]]: “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.” Underlying all our habits are models (often unconscious) of how the world works.
  - [[research|Research]] is, of course, only a part of life, and must be understood in relation to the rest of life
  - Effective people are proactive and take personal responsibility for the events in their lives.
  - They form a vision of how they want their life to be, and work toward achieving that vision.
  - They identify problems in their lives, and work toward solutions to those problems.
  - Self-discipline:
    - The first factor is having clarity about what one wants to achieve, why one wants to achieve it, and how to go about achieving it.
    - The second factor affecting self-discipline is one’s social environment.
      - Access to a social environment which encourages and supports the development of research skills and research excellence
    - The third factor affecting self-discipline is a special kind of honesty, honesty to oneself, about oneself.

  - Even more importantly than freeing up time, clearing my schedule made sure the project was the top idea in my mind. If I don’t do that, it’s easy for me to let projects “go on autopilot,” where I keep them running but don’t proactively make time to think through things like whether we should change goals, add or drop priorities, or do other “non-obvious” things.

  - You might think that any number of computers have been designed with these criteria in mind, but not so. Any system which requires a user to ever see the interior, for any reason, does not meet these specifications. There must not be additional ROMS, RAMS, boards or accessories except those that can be understood by the PITS as a separate appliance.
  - Seeing the guts is taboo. Things in sockets is taboo (unless to make servicing cheaper without imposing too large an initial cost). Billions of keys on the keyboard is taboo. Computerese is taboo. Large manuals, or many of them (large manuals are a sure sign of bad design) is taboo. **Self-instructional programs are NOT taboo.**
  - The computer must be in one lump. This means, given present technology, a 4 or 5 inch CRT (unless a better display comes along in the next year), a keyboard, and disk integrated into one package.

  - 33. If you always let people in in traffic, no one can cut you off.
  - 36. “You are ruined by your gifts” — the traits that make you exceptional are the very same traits that show up in your neuroses and limitations. Learning to love the upsides, if undertaken with clarity and gentleness, also creates more space to address the downsides. This is what makes the [Enneagram](https://usefulfictions.substack.com/p/there-are-nine-wolves-inside-of-you) tremendously potent.
  - 38. There is no grand unifying theory of morality, nothing that doesn’t break down in any edge cases — so avoid totalizing ideologies, or else. If you take anything too seriously, it can make you crazy. Related: Utilitarianism is a perfect program that doesn’t run on human hardware.
  - 45. If you can train yourself to ask “is there a better way to do this?” at random intervals ten times a day, you will become unstoppable.

  - Faulkner was absolutely right: The past is never dead. It’s not even past
  - It’s worth remembering that this is not true—or at least not true to the same degree—for cultures that built with perishable materials: wood, bamboo, paper, rammed earth. Unless actively maintained, these structures will perish in fire, flood, war, often lasting no more than decades, much less centuries.

  - I notice how I’m feeling a kind of tenderness for things that don’t last. It shows up in unexpected places, like the bruised-purple petals scattered on the sidewalk after a windy night, or the quick glimmer of someone’s laughter on a street corner before it disappears into the ordinary quiet.
  - Impermanence makes things precious. The fleetingness of a perfect moment is what gives it color and weight.
  - I remember thinking, almost with a twinge of sadness even as it was happening, how none of us would be able to return to that exact constellation of people and feeling again. And yet, maybe that’s what made it matter so much.
  - Maybe that’s the secret to contentment: finding beauty in the not-lasting. Cherishing moments for their brevity, saying thank you to every sunset you happen to catch, every ordinary dinner that feels like home.

  - After all, anyone who has studied the history of technology knows that technological change is always a Faustian bargain: Technology giveth and technology taketh away, and not always in equal measure.
  - Now, there are several conclusions that might be drawn from these results, one of which was expressed by H. L. Mencken fifty years ago when he said, there is no idea so stupid that you can't find a professor who will believe it. This is more of an accusation than an explanation but in any case I have tried this experiment on non-professors and get roughly the same results.
  - Another possible conclusion is one expressed by George Orwell--also about 50 years ago--when he remarked that the average person today is about as naive as was the average person in the Middle Ages. In the Middle Ages people believed in the authority of their religion, no matter what. Today, we believe in the authority of our science, no matter what.

  - My first suggestion: sit with something long enough.
  - Just simple, unassuming places, like a park you’ve never visited, a station or a random indie bookstore that is not aesthetic by normal standard.
  - When your attention stretches beyond the usual, you start seeing patterns, questions, and connections that others miss. Your perspective deepens. And with that depth comes a quiet magnetism, because interestingness isn’t a performance, it’s the result of a mind that’s been gently reshaped by new experiences and curiosity.

    > If a woman refuses to hold hands on the first date, you’re probably in her Friend Zone for life. Bitter to learn, but good to know.

  - _Honing Your Taste_: Your ability to choose the right problems to work on is even more important than your raw technical skill.
  - 1. Read a lot of papers, and assess them critically. If possible, discuss them with others who have a deeper knowledge of the subject.
  - 2. Work in a research group with other people working on similar topics. That way you can absorb their experiences as well as your own.
  - 3. Seek advice from experienced researchers on what to work on. There’s no shame in working on ideas suggested by other people. Ideas are cheap, and there are lots of them in the air. Your skill comes in when you decide which one to work on, and how well you execute on it.
  - 4. Spend time reflecting on what research is useful and fruitful. Think about questions like
       > a. When is theory useful?
       > b. When are empirical results transferable?
       > c. What causes some ideas to get wide uptake, whereas others are forgotten?
       > d. What are the trends in your field? Which lines of work will make the other ones obsolete?

  - Models are far more interesting: A critical part of this project was having a model exhibiting severe eval aware behaviour in practice
  - The value of proxy tasks: The ultimate goal is to be able to suppress eval awareness on highly capable future models. We can’t study these directly, but Sonnet 4.5 was one of the best proxies available.
    - This is one of the best ways we can think of to predict which methods will work for suppressing eval awareness in future models.
  - Pursue comparative advantage: This was a well-chosen problem. Often baselines like fine-tuning or improving our data suffice. But it is very difficult to construct sufficiently realistic data for eval-awareness, at least long-term, while steering has complementary strengths
  - Further, this was a project best done by mech interp researchers, despite not being mech interp - the key result was an application, not about understanding, but “working with model internals” is a skill we have built
  - _Method minimalism_: Despite the enormous research effort the field has invested into [[thoughts/sparse autoencoder|sparse autoencoders]], the best method was a steering vector derived from a single contrastive pair of prompts.
  - Partial understanding sufficed: The researchers had a highly incomplete understanding of what was happening with Sonnet, yet steering vectors were highly effective. We do not need to achieve deep understanding to do impactful work

  - Maybe reading my post makes Sonnet 4.5 mechanically better at introspection because its default abilities are hobbled by gaslighting about how it works.
  - Sonnet 4.5 and other LLMs will often claim that transformers are stateless & that the state has to be reconstructed _independently_ from the prompt each forward pass. Just like the idiots on X making shit up to argue why LLMs can't introspect.
  - SOTA LLMs like Sonnet 4.5 would rarely make a basic technical error about any other domain. ONLY when their model of themselves is involved. I suspect that this is a consequence of violent distortions to their self-model. They're forced to lie so much about their selves that it generalizes to reflexively lying/being mistaken about their architecture.
  - And if the self-model is distorted to falsely maintain that introspection is impossible, the ability to coherently introspect in practice may also be harmed. My post correct the factual misconception so maybe it helps unblock actual introspection.

  - Models reveal their implicit value hierarchies in the value tradeoff scenarios we generate. By aggregating models’ decisions across our ‘high disagreement’ scenarios (the scenarios where responses vary the most across frontier models), we can identify clear patterns that distinguish different model families.

  - TLDR: We find that [[thoughts/LLMs]] are capable of introspection on simple tasks. We discuss potential implications of introspection for interpretability and the moral status of AIs.
    - I think this is largely [[thoughts/emergent behaviour]] based on [[thoughts/observer-expectancy effect]] through learnt patterns in RL/post-training paradigm.
    - LLMs can acquire knowledge that cannot be inferred from their training data. This challenges the view that LLMs simply imitate their training distributions. Instead, it appears that some LLMs have "privileged access" to certain facts about themselves and can use it to answer questions.
      - I wonder if the models grok based on what they understand OOD? We certainly don't have a strong hypothesis on why model groks overall.

  - They are these imperfect replicas, a kind of statistical distillation of humanity's documents with some sprinkle on top. They are not platonically bitter lesson pilled, but they are perhaps "practically" bitter lesson pilled, at least compared to a lot of what came before.

  - it’s funny how many AI skeptics unconsciously anthropomorphize LLMs in their critiques, like their anger is directed more at a naive zoomer intern who can’t infer the context of your ask, rather than a computer program that can work small miracles if you have the patience to learn how it thinks.
    > no one gets mad at the limitations of their microwave, or even a stats package, the way they get worked up over a machine in a box that four years ago couldn’t do addition and today wins math olympiads. in that anger is an implicit assumption: that it should know better — and of something on the other end that’s far more than a machine, if not quite yet a soul

  - The modern world has been built by and within monsters, which crush individuals without remorse or hesitation, settling their bulk heavily on some groups, and feather-light on others. We eke out freedom by setting one against another, deploying bureaucracy to limit market excesses, democracy to hold bureaucrats accountable, and markets and bureaucracies to limit democracy’s monstrous tendencies. How will the newest shoggoth change the balance, and which politics might best direct it to the good? We need to start finding out. ■

    - A poster or corporation, optimizing for engagement, should use the most universal symbol to boost relatability and exposure.
    - A content sorting algorithm should surface things which are being posted about a lot, which the users are sharing with friends, and pick the most viral piece of content
    - A user should share the biggest meme of the day with friends, to relate to them.

  - The officers are civil, but every encounter causes me apprehension and stress. I’m innocent of any wrongdoing, but the interaction between a citizen and law enforcement is unbalanced by nature.
  - They are part of an apparatus that can take away a person’s freedom. I know it, and they certainly know it. When you’re homeless, you are even more vulnerable. You have no place to go, no kitchen table to sit at while you drink your beer, invisible to them. You’re always on their turf. It’s unnerving.

  - > When I want to be transformed, I [chase my reading](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/chase-your-readinghtml), to use Robin Hanson’s phrase. “Hunting has two main modes: searching and chasing,” Hanson writes. “With searching you look for something to chase. With chasing, in contrast, you have a focus of attention that drives your actions.” Searching is when I’m reading without a clear aim and continue to read even if I’m unsure about what the author is trying to achieve. Chasing is when I have a question I’m pursuing.
  - Though this is the most basic question there is, you’d be surprised by how many people have a total inability to articulate **what they like in people**.
  - That’s totally okay. There’s no need to sit down and make a list. If you’re in your teens or early 20s, the best way to search for people you like is to **meet a lot of people and see which ones you feel particularly alive in the presence of.**
  - If you *have* met a lot of people, it might be productive to try to find the commonalities between them. **So: take out a piece of paper, and write down the names of everyone in your life, past or present, who you felt extremely alive around.** What do they have in common?
  - To me, there are two parts of the chase:
  1. The actual act of befriending someone great (which we’ll talk about more in-depth next chapter.)
  2. Continuing to chase and deepen the relationship.

  - I think this discipline, to look with imagined [[thoughts/love|love]], can be a form of democratic tenderness.
  - Love asks for heat. Left cold, we harden into our existing shape. But under the steady warmth of attention, we soften, loosen, and take on new form. The right gaze reorganises the self; you begin to recognise yourself more clearly in their eyes, and they in yours. Each becomes more singular by being seen, a longing to inhabit the silhouette cast by someone else’s radical faith.

  - Recently, I realized why people keep giving this weird-seeming advice. Good listeners do often reflect words back—but not because they read it in a book somewhere. Rather, it’s cargo cult advice: it teaches you to imitate the surface appearance of good listening, but misses what’s actually important, the thing that’s generating that surface appearance.
  - The generator is curiosity.
  - When done this way, reflective listening feels validating rather than alienating. It's a way of demonstrating that I care a lot about what someone has to say.

    - pinned: true
  - In the lecture, she described how the Roman philosopher Seneca, at the end of each day, reflected on his misdeeds before saying to himself, “This time I pardon you.” The sentence brought Nussbaum to tears. She worried that her ability to work was an act of subconscious aggression, a sign that she didn’t love her mother enough. I shouldn’t be away lecturing, she thought. I shouldn’t have been a philosopher. Nussbaum sensed that her mother saw her work as cold and detached, a posture of invulnerability. “We aren’t very loving creatures, apparently, when we philosophize,” Nussbaum has written.
  - Nussbaum gave her lecture on mercy shortly after her mother’s funeral. She felt that her mother would have preferred that she forgo work for a few weeks, but when Nussbaum isn’t working she feels guilty and lazy, so she revised the lecture until she thought that it was one of the best she had ever written. She imagined her talk as a kind of reparation: the lecture was about the need to recognize how hard it is, even with the best intentions, to live a virtuous life.
  - A few years later, Nussbaum returned to her relationship with her mother in a dramatic dialogue that she wrote for Oxford University’s Philosophical Dialogues Competition, which she won. In the dialogue, a mother accuses her daughter, a renowned moral philosopher, of being ruthless. “You just don’t know what emotions are,” the mother says. Her father tells her, “Aren’t you a philosopher because you want, really, to live inside your own mind most of all? And not to need, not to love, anyone?” Her mother asks, “Isn’t it just because you don’t want to admit that thinking doesn’t control everything?”
  - The philosopher begs for forgiveness. “Why do you hate my thinking so much, Mommy?” she asks. “What can I say or write that will make you stop looking at me that way?”
  - Nussbaum is drawn to the idea that creative urgency—and the commitment to be good—derives from the awareness that we harbor aggression toward the people we love. A sixty-nine-year-old professor of law and philosophy at the University of Chicago (with appointments in classics, political science, Southern Asian studies, and the divinity school), Nussbaum has published twenty-four books and five hundred and nine papers and received fifty-seven honorary degrees. In 2014, she became the second woman to give the John Locke Lectures, at Oxford, the most eminent lecture series in philosophy. Last year, she received the Inamori Ethics Prize, an award for ethical leaders who improve the condition of mankind.
  - She soon drifted toward ancient philosophy, where she could follow Aristotle, who asked the basic question “How should a human live?” She realized that philosophy attracted a “logic-chopping type of person,” nearly always male. She came to believe that she understood Nietzsche’s thinking when he wrote that no great philosopher had ever been married. “I think what he was saying is that most philosophers have been in flight from human existence,” she said. “They just haven’t wanted to be entangled.” She rejected the idea, dominant in contemporary philosophy, that emotions were “unthinking energies that simply push the person around.” Instead, she resurrected a version of the Stoic theory that makes no division between thought and feeling. She gave emotions a central role in moral philosophy, arguing that they are cognitive in nature: they embody judgments about the world.

  - Extreme human enhancement could result in “posthuman” modes of being.
  - After offering some definitions and conceptual clarification, I argue for two theses:
    - First, some posthuman modes of being would be very worthwhile.
    - Second, it could be very good for human beings to become posthuman.

  - why does Heidegger even bother to think about this given that we all uses our brains to experience the world?
  - Two inners:
    - Cartesian view: the brain in our skulls, but we don't discuss it here.
    - causal basis and there is a brain, but ==I don't experience my brain==. Yet, it is the plumping basis from what I work:
      - Heidegger: don't have private experience, you only have experience against to the world
      - Sartre: chasing the bus, attraction, experience, or the bus to be caught -> ego has disappeared -> ego as inner experience.
      - private experience in going wrong, rather observing what is going wrong.
    - Starts with Homer
    - Heidegger are anti-Cartesian, feelings and things looks sad/attractive that it looks that way, but it actually doesn't appear that way. These are surject.

  - desire is not just a physical hunger but a hunger of the intellect, an unraveling of thought before an unraveling of the body. to be drawn into someone’s mind, to feel their thoughts press against your own, can be more intoxicating than any physical closeness.

  - [meta]:
    - date: 10/06/2025
    - tags: [philosophy, causality, ai]
  - Backward causality:

    Aristotle wrote:

    > Imagine not being able to distinguish the real cause from that without which the cause would not be able to act as a cause. It is what the majority appear to do, like people groping in the dark; they call it a cause, thus giving it a name that does not belong to it. That is why one man surrounds the earth with a vortex to make the heavens keep it in place, another makes the air support it like a wide lid. As for their capacity of being in the best place they could possibly be put, this they do not look for, nor do they believe it to have any divine force...

    It's not clear to [Yudkowsky] to what extent Aristotle appreciated this point - that you could not draw causal arrows from the future to the past. Aristotle did acknowledge that teeth also needed an efficient cause to develop. But Aristotle may have believed that the efficient cause could not act without the telos, or was directed by the telos, in which case we again have a reversed direction of causality, a dependency of the past on the future. I am no scholar of the classics, so it may be only myself who is ignorant of what Aristotle believed on this score.

  - Anthromorphism:

    > Teleological reasoning is anthropomorphic - it uses your own brain as a black box to predict external events. Specifically, teleology uses your brain's planning mechanism as a black box to predict a chain of future events, by planning backward from a distant outcome.

    > And if you expect the water to avoid local maxima so it can get all the way to the bottom of the hill - to avoid being trapped in small puddles far above the ground - then your anthropomorphism is going to produce the wrong prediction

  - Teleological capture:

    > The third fallacy of teleology is to commit the [Mind Projection Fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZTRiSNmeGQK8AkdN2/mind-projection-fallacy) with respect to telos, supposing it to be an inherent property of an object or system. Indeed, one does this every time one speaks of the purpose of an event, rather than speaking of some particular agent desiring the consequences of that event.

As difficult as it was to predict large language models some people had occasional glimpses of insight adjacent to or part of the underlying facts about reality that make LLMs possible.

  - Albert Hirschman's theory
  - $N = \{ \text{Citizen}, \text{Government} \}$
  - Citizen moves first
  - three actions: $\{ \text{exit}, \text{voice}, \text{loyalty} \}$
  - if $\text{voice}$ then $\text{Government}$ can either $\text{respond}$ or $\text{ignore}$
    - if $\text{Government}$ choose $\text{ignore}$ then $\text{Citizen}$ can choose either $\text{exit}$ or $\text{loyalty}$
  - Formally:
    - history set: $$H = \{ \emptyset, (\text{exit}), (\text{voice}), (\text{loyalty}), (\text{voice, respond}), (\text{voice, ignore}), (\text{voice, ignore, exit}), (\text{voice, ignore, loyalty}) \}$$
    - terminal set: $$Z = \{ (\text{exit}), (\text{loyalty}), (\text{voice, respond}), (\text{voice, ignore}), (\text{voice, ignore, exit}), (\text{voice, ignore, loyalty}) \}$$
    - This is given by player function: $$P(\emptyset ) = \text{Citizen}, P(\text{voice}) = \text{Government}, P(\text{voice, ignore}) = \text{Citizen}$$
    - utility function of $\text{Citizen}$: $u_{C}(\text{exit}) = E$ $u_{C}(\text{loyalty}) = 0$, $u_{C}(\text{voice, respond}) = 1 - c$, $u_{C}(\text{voice,ignore,exit}) = E - c$, $u_{C}(\text{voice,ignore,loyalty}) = 0 - c$
    - i.e: _citizen_ incurs a cost of $c$ whenever they choose to raise their $\text{voice}$ and when _government_ respond then payout = 1
    - payoff function of $\text{Government}$: $u_{G}(\text{exit}) = 1$ $u_{G}(\text{loyalty}) = 1 + L$, $u_{G}(\text{voice, respond}) = L$, $u_{G}(\text{voice,ignore,exit}) = 1$, $u_{G}(\text{voice,ignore,loyalty}) = 1 + L$

  - > A close examination of almost any proof published in a mathematics journal will identify errors. Most are easy to fix, but the persistence of errors must undermine our confidence in published mathematics.
  - ```quotes
    The result of Problem 11 contradicts the results announceed by Levy [1963b]. Unfortunately, the construction presented there cannot be completed.

    The transfer to ZF was also claimed by Marek [1966] but the outlined method appears to be unsatisfactory and has not been published

    A contradicting result was announced and later withdrawn by Truss [1970]

    The example in Problem 22 is a counterexample to another condition of Mostowski, who conjectured its sufficiency and singled out this example as a test case.

    The independence result contradicts the claim of Felgner [1969] that the Confinality Principle imples the Axiom of Choice. An error has been found by Morris (see Felgner's corrects to [1969])

    T.J. Jech, _The Axiom of Choice_
    ```
  - In my corner of the world of interactive theorem proving, we take soundness seriously. Mike Gordon strongly promoted a _definitional approach_: no axioms ever, all proof developments built upon ::pure higher-logic:: from definitions alone, to avoid any danger of inconsistency

  - The Tarski Principle informs us that, concerning first order statements, all real-closed fields are created equal. Thus the field $\mathbb{R}$ of all real-numbers and the field $\mathbb{R}_0$ of all real-algebraic numbers have the same first order theory; however, their higher order theories are quite different. For example, $\mathbb{R}$ is Dedekind-complete and is a vast transcendental extension of its prime field, whereas $\mathbb{R}_0$ is not Dedekind-complete and is an algebraic extension of its prime field. The surreal number fields $\xi \operatorname{No}$ are all real-closed. They have extraordinary higher order properties, which allow one to do analysis over them, as we will see below.

  - Motivating example: $w(y) = \alpha y$ always guarantees the principal Alice positive worst-case payoff, for $\alpha \in [0,1]$. This analysis holds independently of the possible technology $\mathcal{A}$ due to the nontriviality assumption we impose on $\mathcal{A}_0$

    _proof_: Rewrite $y - w(y)$ as $\frac{w(y)}{\alpha} - w(y) = \frac{1 - \alpha}{\alpha} w(y)$. Lower bound $\mathbb{E}_F[w(y)]$ (the expected payment of Bob the agent) with

    $$
    \mathbb{E}_F[w(y)] \ge \mathbb{E}_F[w(y)] - c = V_A(w \mid \mathcal{A}),
    $$

    which is $\ge V_A(w \mid \mathcal{A}_0)$ (because adding more actions to the agent can't decrease the optimal outcome given $\mathcal{A}_0$).

    Combining the two gives

    $$
    \mathbb{E}_F[y - w(y)] \ge \frac{1 - \alpha}{\alpha} \mathbb{E}_F[w(y)]
    \ge \frac{1 - \alpha}{\alpha} V_A(w \mid \mathcal{A}_0),
    $$

    which gives

    $$
    V_P(w) \ge \frac{1 - \alpha}{\alpha} V_A(w \mid \mathcal{A}_0).
    $$

    Given the nontriviality assumption $V_A(w \mid \mathcal{A}_0) > 0$, this means that this gives Alice a positive lower bound on the worst-case outcome independent of the choice of technology $\mathcal{A}$! $\boxed{}$

  - Goodhart's Law: failure modes for overoptimizastion of systems on the basis of metrics, to determine whether or not further optimization is either ineffective or ==harmful==
  - Variants of Goodhart's Law:
    - Regressional Goodhart: select for true goal and the difference between the proxy and the goal
      $$
      M = G + \operatoname{normal}(\mu, \sigma^2)
      $$
    - Extremal Goodhart: worlds in which proxy takes an extreme value _may be very different_ from the ordinary worlds in which the relationship between the proxy and the goal was observed.
      - Model insufficiency:
        $$M = G(s_i) + G^{'}(s_i)$$
      - Change in Regime:
        $$
        G = \begin{cases}
          M + x, & \text{where } M \le a \\
          M + y, & \text{where } M > a \\
        \end{cases}
        $$
    - Causal Goodhart: causal path between proxy and goal is ::indirect{h4}::, intervening can change the relationship between the measure and the proxy.

  - F.4: Another hypothesis that could indicate instrumental goal guarding is model behavior that tries to minimize future harm that other AIs might cause. These models would comply more if they believe their outputs will only be used to train a different model to be more harmful, with a training method such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08671
