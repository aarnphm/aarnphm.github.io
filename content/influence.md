I think a lot about this [[quotes#^life-jobs-smart|quote]] from Steve Jobs, and realised that you are who you surrounded yourself with. Whether online, daily, we often populate our minds and time by the people we hang around or work with.

The following lists of people who I owed a lot. I would separate from top-to-bottom a list from "people-i-know-that-makes-me-whole" to "humans-being-in-the-wild-that-reminds-me-how-beautiful-life-really-is" (separated with `**`):

- [Jacky](https://jzhao.xyz/), for always encouraging me to think hardly, even from afar
- [Chaoyu](https://twitter.com/chaoyu_), for taking a bet on me, four years ago
- [Sean](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssheng/), for probably the best manager/friend that I can go to whenever I have problems.
- All my colleagues at [that one infrastructure startup](https://bentoml.com/), for your trust in me for the past four years.
- [Tommy](https://tommytrinh.me/), for your laughs, and going through life with pure determinism.
- [Kelly](https://www.kellychong.ca/), for you opinionated thoughts, being real, and your wonderful [[thoughts/taste]].
- [Wilbur](https://www.wilburzhang.com/), for your thoughts, vulnerability, and utmost trust in sharing your inner thoughts with me.
- [Rabs](https://linktr.ee/rabiasohail), for your trust, kindness and being so damn ==real== :smiley:
- [Gourob](https://x.com/PodderGourob), for your trust in my abilities
- Chi, for your care and endless laughter.
- Nicole, for being the one that stay while the rest of the world walk away.
- Jesse, for your endurance, for reminding me that I don't have to walk through this dark forest alone.
- Mimi and TA, for unequivocally reminding me of my roots, [[thoughts/being|being]] Vietnamese, and _frozen grapes influencer_.
- my mom, for being probably one of the coolest human being, albeit with some minor hiccups (but you know, generational difference).
- my dad, for his silence, love through actions.
- my brother, for being nothing less but an inspiration for me to always keep pushing forward.
- Anh Q and chi L, for being the ==True North== that light the path whenever I felt loss.
