I think a lot about this [[quotes#^life-jobs-smart|quote]] from Steve Jobs, and realised that you are who you surrounded yourself with.
Whether online, daily, we often populate our minds and time by the people we hang around or work with.

The following lists of people who I owed a lot. I would separate from top-to-bottom a list from people-i-know-that-makes-me-whole to humans-being-in-the-wild-that-reminds-me-how-beautiful-life-really-is (separated with `**`):

- [Jacky](https://jzhao.xyz/), for always encouraging me to think hardly, even from afar
- [Chaoyu](https://twitter.com/chaoyu_), for taking a bet on me, four years ago
- [Sean](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ssheng/), for probably the best manager/friend that I can go to whenever I have problems
- [Tommy](https://tommytrinh.me/), for your laughs, and going through life with determinism
- [Kelly](https://www.kellychong.ca/), for you opinionated thoughts, being real, and your wonderful [[thoughts/taste]]
- [Wilbur](https://www.wilburzhang.com/), for your thoughts, vulnerability, and utmost trust in sharing your inner thoughts with me.
- Nicole, for being the one that stay while the rest of the world walk away.
- Chi, for your care and endless laughter
- Jesse, for your endurance, for reminding me that I don't have to walk through this dark forest of life alone.
- Mimi and TA, for unequivocally reminding me of my roots and [[thoughts/being|being]] Vietnamese
- my mom, for being probably one of the coolest human being, albeit with some minor hiccups (but you know, generational difference)
- my dad, for his silence, love through actions

\*\*

- [Hank and John](https://www.youtube.com/@vlogbrothers), banger writing and videos
- [Kieran](https://www.fourtet.net/), folktronica, or just pure vibes
- Steven Soderbergh
