## On life.

Throw me some wisdom, and advices? I have none. -- Jesse

Your life so far is a drawing canvas. You can't change what's already been drawn, but you can always paint a new line. -- paraphrased from [@tommytrxnh](https://twitter.com/tommytrxnh)

20 years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. -- Mark Twain

Sometimes, we [care] too much about potential, less on credentials -- Kate

## On bits and bytes.

Computer is a bicycle for the mind. -- [Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c&ab_channel=MichaelLawrence)

All I can say to the young is close your eyes. -- Ted Nelson

An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes, which can be made, in a very narrow field. -- Niels Bohr

## On perspectives.

Our capacity to deal with [[thoughts/Language|language]] is a complex, genetically-determined part of our biological endowment. It's a product of evolution, part of our nature. -- Noam Chomsky

The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new [[thoughts/Language|language]] sounds most strangely. The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions — that the renunciation of false opinions would be [a renunciation of life]. -- [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche]]

I always feel happy, you know why? Because I don’t expect anything from anyone. Expectations always hurt. Life is short. So love your life. Be Happy. & Keep smiling. Just live for yourself & before you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you pray, forgive. Before you hurt, feel. Before you hate, love. Before you quit, try. Before you die, live. -- William Shakespeare

A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty. -- Winston Churchill

People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are -- Steve Jobs

_The moral thing that should wish to say is very simple. I should say: ==Love is wise, hatred is foolish==_ -- [Bertrand Russell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihaB8AFOhZo&ab_channel=PhilosophieKanal)

## On drive.

==Life can be much broader when you discover one simple fact...that everything around you was made up by people no smarter than you.... Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.==-- Steve Jobs ^life-jobs-smart

I just wondered how things were put together. -- Claude Shannon

Never stop learning. Assume nothing, question everything. Teach others what you know. Analyze objectively -- Richard Feynman

The first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool. -- Richard Feynman

Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. -- Winston Churchill

[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. -- Richard Hamming

## On randomness and fun.

I have to be successful because I like expensive things. -- some random person on twitter

People like you think I get lucky. Here's the thing, I make my own luck. -- Harvey Specter
