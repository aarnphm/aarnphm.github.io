## On life.

![[are.na#^coparent]]

> An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity, a physicist tries to make it simple. For an idiot, the more complicated something is, the more he will admire it. If you make something so clusterfucked he can’t understand it, he’s gonna think you’re a god because you made it so complicated nobody can understand it. That’s how they write journals in academics, they try to make it so complicated people think you’re a genius.

> The First [Friend] is the alter ego, the man who first reveals to you that you are not alone in the world by turning out (beyond hope) to share all your most secret delights. There is nothing to be overcome in making him your friend; he and you join like raindrops on a window. But the Second Friend is the man who disagrees with you about everything. He is not so much the alter ego as the antiself. Of course he shares your interests; otherwise he would not become your friend at all. But he has approached them all at a different angle. He has read all the right books but has got the wrong thing out of every one. It is as if he spoke your language but mispronounced it. How can he be so nearly right and yet, invariably, just not right? He is as fascinating (and infuriating) as a woman. When you set out to correct his heresies, you will find that he forsooth to correct yours! And then you go at it, hammer and tongs, far into the night, night after night, or walking through fine country that neither gives a glance to, each learning the weight of the other’s punches, and often more like mutually respectful enemies than friends. Actually (though it never seems so at the time) you modify one another’s thought; out of this perpetual dogfight a community of mind and a deep affection emerge.

> But no matter the medicinal virtues of being a true friend or sustaining a long close relationship with another, the ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the self nor of the other, the ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having ==been seen== by someone and the _equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence_ of another, to have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.

> —David Whyte

> [[thoughts/love|Love]] is reverence, and worship, and glory, and the upward glance. Not a bandage for dirty sores. But they don't know it. Those who speak of love most promiscuously are the ones who've never felt it. They make some sort of feeble stew out of sympathy, compassion, contempt, and general indifference, and they call it love. Once you've felt what it means to love as you and I know it - total passion for the total height - you're incapable of anything less...

>
> —the internet

> It took me most of my life to understand this: the people who care the most about you are often the ones who can hurt you the most. Not because they mean to, but because they got in. They gave you what you'd been _looking for_. But life happens. Fear creeps in. People mess up. They run, shut down, say things they don't mean or stay silent when it matters the most. And suddenly you're left questioning if it ever meant anything at all. _It did._ They cared. _Maybe still do._ But now you get to find out if they belong in your life. The ones who want to stay will _show up._ The ones who don't will _fade._

> —the internet

> _Marriage as a long conversation._ When entering a marriage, one should ask the question: do you think you will be able to have good conversations with this woman right into old age? Everything else in marriage is transitory, but most of the time in interaction is spent in conversation.
>
> —F. [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]

> The longer I live, the more deeply I learn that love — whether we call it friendship or family or romance — is the work of mirroring and magnifying each other’s light. Gentle work. Steadfast work. Life-saving work in those moments when life and shame and sorrow occlude our own light from our view, but there is still a clear-eyed loving person to beam it back. In our best moments, we are that person for another.

> —James Baldwin, Nothing Personal

> I would say that free will is nothing but our conscious experience of deciding what to do, which I know I am experiencing as I write this review, and this experience is not invalidated by the reflection that physical laws made it inevitable that I would want to make these decisions.

> Reform our infantilized society. Give people the tools to resist and destroy consumer culture (ubiquitous emotionally-manipulative branding and advertising, materialism, artificial fashions) and the corporation’s oligarchical control over employment, entertainment, and creativity. Return power, dignity, and responsibility to the individual.

>
> —Noam Chomsky

> The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new [[thoughts/Language|language]] sounds most strangely. The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions — that the renunciation of false opinions would be [a renunciation of life].
>
> —[[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche]]

> I always feel happy, you know why? Because I don’t expect anything from anyone. Expectations always hurt. Life is short. So love your life. Be Happy. & Keep smiling. Just live for yourself & before you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you pray, forgive. Before you hurt, feel. Before you hate, love. Before you quit, try. Before you die, live.

> —Winston Churchill

> Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and [[thoughts/Camus#definition of absurd|absurdities]] no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense.
>
> —Ralph Waldo Emerson

> People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are
>
> —Steve Jobs

> _The moral thing that should wish to say is very simple. I should say: ==Love is wise, hatred is foolish==_

> It is actually ok to miss somebody. [...] But you know that sadness, it's a gift, a lovely thing to feel in a way, because it means you really love somebody when you miss them. It makes me feel close to her when I miss her in a strange way [that our heart desires]. And when I miss [my mom] I remember all of the cuddles I used to get from her. [The reason why] I remember is because she made me so happy so that I can celebrate her and miss her at the same time
