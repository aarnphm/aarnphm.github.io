## On life.

Throw me some wisdom, and advices? I have none. -- J

Your life so far is a drawing canvas. You can't change what's already been drawn, but you can always paint a new line. -- [Tommy](https://twitter.com/tommytrxnh) ^tommy

20 years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. -- Mark Twain

Sometimes, we [care] too much about potential, less on credentials -- K

But no matter the medicinal virtues of being a true friend or sustaining a long close relationship with another, the ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the self nor of the other, the ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having ==been seen== by someone and the _equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence_ of another, to have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone. —- David Whyte

[[tags/love|Love]] is reverence, and worship, and glory, and the upward glance. Not a bandage for dirty sores. But they don't know it. Those who speak of love most promiscuously are the ones who've never felt it. They make some sort of feeble stew out of sympathy, compassion, contempt, and general indifference, and they call it love. Once you've felt what it means to love as you and I know it - total passion for the total height - you're incapable of anything less... -- Ayn Rand

In another life, I would have really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you -- Ke Huy Quan ([[/movies#^eeao|Everything Everywhere All at Once]])

You don't know about real loss, because it only occurs when you [[posts/her|love]] something more than you love yourself. I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much -- Robin Williams ([[/movies#^gwh|Good Will Hunting]])

When you do something, do it 100%. When you work, work. When you laugh, laugh. When you eat, eat like it's your last meal -- Tony the valet ([[posts/physical touch|Green Book]])

Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards. -- Søren Kierkegaard

I am full of the sky, and the sky is full of feeling -- [Jasmine](https://x.com/j_asminewang/status/1950598766136090904)

==The most personal is the most creative== -- Martin Scorsese

When you are not fed [[tags/love]] with a spoon you learn to lick it with a knife

Wanting to feel wanted is the loneliest feeling ever

It took me most of my life to understand this: the people who care the most about you are often the ones who can hurt you the most. Not because they mean to, but because they got in. They gave you what you'd been _looking for_. But life happens. Fear creeps in. People mess up. They run, shut down, say things they don't mean or stay silent when it matters the most. And suddenly you're left questioning if it ever meant anything at all. _It did._ They cared. _Maybe still do._ But now you get to find out if they belong in your life. The ones who want to stay will _show up._ The ones who don't will _fade._

_Marriage as a long conversation._ When entering a marriage, one should ask the question: do you think you will be able to have good conversations with this woman right into old age? Everything else in marriage is transitory, but most of the time in interaction is spent in conversation. -- F. Nietzsche

"The longer I live, the more deeply I learn that love — whether we call it friendship or family or romance — is the work of mirroring and magnifying each other’s light. Gentle work. Steadfast work. Life-saving work in those moments when life and shame and sorrow occlude our own light from our view, but there is still a clear-eyed loving person to beam it back. In our best moments, we are that person for another." — James Baldwin, Nothing Personal

I would say that free will is nothing but our conscious experience of deciding what to do, which I know I am experiencing as I write this review, and this experience is not invalidated by the reflection that physical laws made it inevitable that I would want to make these decisions. -- Steven Weinberg

I always have such need to merely talk to you. Even when I have nothing to talk about - with you I just seem to right ahead and sort of invent it. I invent it for you -- Virginia Woolf, from a letter to _Vita Sackville West_

## On bits and bytes.

Computer is a bicycle for the mind. -- [Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c&ab_channel=MichaelLawrence)

All I can say to the young is close your eyes. -- Ted Nelson

An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes, which can be made, in a very narrow field. -- Niels Bohr

What is [software](https://worrydream.com/MagicInk/) for? People turn to software to learn, to create, and to communicate. -- Bret Victor

Notice that the quality of the AI output is mostly irrelevant for these points. If you have good quality AI outputs then you are still welcome to share it with me, given that you are upfront that it is AI generated. -- [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42827532)

## On perspectives.

Our capacity to deal with [[thoughts/Language|language]] is a complex, genetically-determined part of our biological endowment. It's a product of evolution, part of our nature. -- Noam Chomsky

The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new [[thoughts/Language|language]] sounds most strangely. The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions — that the renunciation of false opinions would be [a renunciation of life]. -- [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche]]

I always feel happy, you know why? Because I don’t expect anything from anyone. Expectations always hurt. Life is short. So love your life. Be Happy. & Keep smiling. Just live for yourself & before you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you pray, forgive. Before you hurt, feel. Before you hate, love. Before you quit, try. Before you die, live. -- William Shakespeare

A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty. -- Winston Churchill

Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and [[thoughts/Camus#definition of absurd|absurdities]] no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense. -- Ralph Waldo Emerson

People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are -- Steve Jobs

_The moral thing that should wish to say is very simple. I should say: ==Love is wise, hatred is foolish==_ -- [Bertrand Russell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihaB8AFOhZo&ab_channel=PhilosophieKanal)

Craftsman is knowing how to work, Art is knowing when to stop. -- Ben Affleck

Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country. -- J.F.Kennedy

It is actually ok to miss somebody. [...] But you know that sadness, it's a gift, a lovely thing to feel in a way, because it means you really love somebody when you miss them. It makes me feel close to her when I miss her in a strange way [that our heart desires]. And when I miss [my mom] I remember all of the cuddles I used to get from her. [The reason why] I remember is because she made me so happy so that I can celebrate her and miss her at the same time -- Andrew Garfield on _[[posts/Oanh|grief]]_

Like the generations of leaves, the lives of mortal men. Now the wind scatters the old leaves across the earth, now the living timber bursts with the new buds and spring comes round again. And so with men: as one generation comes to life, another dies away. -- Homer, The Iliad

There is no iron law that postulates that technology must benefit the many at the expense of the few. And quite naturally, when large swaths of the populace are left behind by technological change, they are likely to resist it. -- Carl Benedikt Frey

## On drive.

Life can be much broader when you discover one simple fact...==that everything around you was made up by people no smarter than you....== Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.-- Steve Jobs ^life-jobs-smart

I just wondered how things were put together. -- Claude Shannon

Highly focused people do not leave their options open. They select their priorities and are comfortable ignoring the rest. If you commit to nothing, you'll be distracted by everything. -- James Clear
