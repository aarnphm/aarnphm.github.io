## On life.

Throw me some wisdom, and advices? I have none. -- Jesse

Your life so far is a drawing canvas. You can't change what's already been drawn, but you can always paint a new line. -- [Tommy](https://twitter.com/tommytrxnh) ^tommy

20 years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbour. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. -- Mark Twain

Sometimes, we [care] too much about potential, less on credentials -- Kate

But no matter the medicinal virtues of being a true friend or sustaining a long close relationship with another, the ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the self nor of the other, the ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having ==been seen== by someone and the _equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence_ of another, to have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone. —- David Whyte

Love is reverence, and worship, and glory, and the upward glance. Not a bandage for dirty sores. But they don't know it. Those who speak of love most promiscuously are the ones who've never felt it. They make some sort of feeble stew out of sympathy, compassion, contempt, and general indifference, and they call it love. Once you've felt what it means to love as you and I know it - total passion for the total height - you're incapable of anything less... -- Ayn Rand

In another life, I would have really liked just doing laundry and taxes with you -- Ke Huy Quan ([[/movies#^eeao|Everything Everywhere All at Once]])

You don't know about real loss, because it only occurs when you [[posts/her|love]] something more than you love yourself. I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much -- Robin Williams ([[/movies#^gwh|Good Will Hunting]])

## On bits and bytes.

Computer is a bicycle for the mind. -- [Steve Jobs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob_GX50Za6c&ab_channel=MichaelLawrence)

All I can say to the young is close your eyes. -- Ted Nelson

An expert is a man who has made all the mistakes, which can be made, in a very narrow field. -- Niels Bohr

Effective system design requires insights drawn from serious [contexts of use](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z51q8prEJzs5Jqa5WPThYoV?stackedNotes=z7EQ2nVGus5B1rS9CqT18g6) -- Andy Matuschak

What is [software](https://worrydream.com/MagicInk/) for? People turn to software to learn, to create, and to communicate. -- Bret Victor

## On perspectives.

Our capacity to deal with [[thoughts/Language|language]] is a complex, genetically-determined part of our biological endowment. It's a product of evolution, part of our nature. -- Noam Chomsky

The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new [[thoughts/Language|language]] sounds most strangely. The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions — that the renunciation of false opinions would be [a renunciation of life]. -- [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche]]

I always feel happy, you know why? Because I don’t expect anything from anyone. Expectations always hurt. Life is short. So love your life. Be Happy. & Keep smiling. Just live for yourself & before you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you pray, forgive. Before you hurt, feel. Before you hate, love. Before you quit, try. Before you die, live. -- William Shakespeare

A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty. -- Winston Churchill

Finish each day and be done with it. You have done what you could. Some blunders and [[thoughts/Camus#definition of absurd|absurdities]] no doubt crept in; forget them as soon as you can. Tomorrow is a new day; begin it well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be cumbered with your old nonsense. -- Ralph Waldo Emerson

People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are -- Steve Jobs

_The moral thing that should wish to say is very simple. I should say: ==Love is wise, hatred is foolish==_ -- [Bertrand Russell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihaB8AFOhZo&ab_channel=PhilosophieKanal)

Craftsman is knowing how to work, Art is knowing when to stop. -- Ben Affleck

Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country. -- J.F.Kennedy

It is actually ok to miss somebody. [...] But you know that sadness, it's a gift, a lovely thing to feel in a way, because it means you really love somebody when you miss them. It makes me feel close to her when I miss her in a strange way [that our heart desires]. And when I miss [my mom] I remember all of the cuddles I used to get from her. [The reason why] I remember is because she made me so happy so that I can celebrate her and miss her at the same time -- Andrew Garfield on _[[posts/Oanh|grief]]_

## On drive.

Life can be much broader when you discover one simple fact...==that everything around you was made up by people no smarter than you....== Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.-- Steve Jobs ^life-jobs-smart

Highly focused people do not leave their options open. They select their priorities and are comfortable ignoring the rest. If you commit to nothing, you'll be distracted by everything. -- James Clear

## On randomness and fun.

I have to be successful because I like expensive things. -- some random person on twitter

People like you think I get lucky. Here's the thing, I make my own luck. -- Harvey Specter

Sticks and stones may breaks my bone, but there will be always something that offend a feminist -- Some random British reporter
