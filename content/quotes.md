> Jacques Lacan

> Essayer is the French verb meaning "to try" and an _essai_ is an attempt. An essay is something you write to try to figure something out [...] In a real essay, you don't take a position and defend it. You notice a door that's ajar, and you open it and walk in to see what's inside.

> A piece of dust.'

> Then, just as he was smiling and starting to look proud, I would say, 'So are the cadavers you cut up. So are the people you think you're curing. They're dust as dust as dust. I reckon a good poem lasts a whole lot longer than a hundred of those people put together.'
>
> And of course Buddy wouldn't have any answer to that, because what I said was true. People were made of nothing so much as dust, and I couldn't see that doctoring all that dust was a bit better than writing poems people would remember and repeat to themselves when they were unhappy or sick or couldn't sleep.
>
> Sylvia Plath, _The Bell Jar_

> Humans can forget anything. It's okay to forget some things, because we are mortal and finite. But some things we have to remember. It's important that we remember. Write to yourself something which will make you remember. ^mnestics

>
> T.S. Eliot

> I know now that psychoanalysis would make sense for me only if I were really serious about the strange possibility of no longer writing, which during the completion of Malte I often dangled in front of my nose as a kind of relief. Then one might let one’s devils be exorcised, since in daily life they are truly just disturbing and painful. And if it happened that the angels left too, one would have to understand this as a further simplification and tell oneself that in the new profession (which?), there would certainly be no use for them.

> Because when I read, I don’t really read; I pop a beautiful sentence into my mouth and suck it like a fruit drop, or I sip it like a liqueur until the thought dissolves in me like alcohol, infusing brain and [[thoughts/love|heart]] and coursing on through the veins to the root of each blood vessel.

> Johann Nestroy, [[library/Philosophical Investigations|[introduction to PI]]]

> if you’re afraid of anger you can set yourself up as a caretaker in unhelpful ways. I think two important things to say to your partner are “I see it from your perspective” and “What can I do to help?” but if you think your job is to make sure your loved one is never upset you’ll experience constant failure

> We shed as we pick up, like travellers who must carry everything in their arms, and what we let fall will be picked up by those behind. The procession is very long and life is very short. We die on the march. But there is nothing outside the march so nothing can be lost to it ^shed

> I think we ought to read only the kind of books that wound and stab us. If the book we’re reading doesn’t wake us up with a blow on the head, what are we reading it for? So that it will make us happy, as you write? Good Lord, we would be happy precisely if we had no books, and the kind of books that make us happy are the kind we could write ourselves if we had to. But we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves, like being banished into forests far from everyone, like a suicide. A book must be the axe for the frozen sea inside us. That is my belief.

> [_a priori_] is belief or claim is said to be justified a priori if its epistemic justification, the reason or warrant for thinking it to be true, does not depend at all on sensory or introspective or other sorts of experience; whereas if its justification does depend at least in part on such experience, it is said to be justified a posteriori or empirically. This specific distinction has to do only with the justification of the belief, and not at all with how the constituent concepts are acquired; thus it is no objection to a claim of a priori justificatory status for a particular belief that experience is required for the acquisition of some of the constituent concepts.

> Love is awful. It’s awful. It’s painful. It’s frightening. It makes you doubt yourself, judge yourself, distance yourself from the other people in your life. It makes you selfish. It makes you creepy, makes you obsessed with your hair, makes you cruel, makes you say and do things you never thought you would do. It’s all any of us want, and it’s hell when we get there. So no wonder it’s something we don’t want to do on our own. I was taught if we’re born with love then life is about choosing the right place to put it. People talk about that a lot, feeling right, when it feels right it’s easy. But I’m not sure that’s true. It takes strength to know what’s right. And love isn’t something that weak people do. Being a romantic takes a hell of a lot of hope. I think what they mean is, when you find somebody that you love, it feels like hope. ^hopeless

> See you soon, my superb. I am so happy at the idea of seeing you again that I laugh just [[thoughts/writing|writing]] it... I kiss you and I hold you to me until Tuesday when we will start again
>
> [[thoughts/Camus|Albert Camus]]' last letter to Maria Casares, before his car crash.

> [...] money spent on feeding friends isn't money spent at all. money spent on [[thoughts/friendship|friends]], to make their lives easier, to share experiences together, to show them something new.
>
> [Malaika](https://malaikaaiyar.me/), from [Jason's blog](https://jason.ml/materialism)

> It is not so much, it seems to me, a so-called “brain power” that makes the difference between this mathematician and another, or between one piece of work and another of a same mathematician; but rather the quality of finesse, of the greater or lesser delicacy of this openness or sensitivity, from one researcher to another or from one moment to another in the same researcher. The most profound and fruitful work is also that which attests to the most delicate sensitivity in apprehending the hidden beauty of things.
>
> Alexandre Grothendieck, Récoltes et Semailles (translation by Childe)

> Sometimes you love someone so much they feel like family, though you don’t share any known ancestors and it’s by no means clear you’ll co-parent with them. ^coparent

> Lydia

> An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity, a physicist tries to make it simple. For an idiot, the more complicated something is, the more he will admire it. If you make something so clusterfucked he can’t understand it, he’s gonna think you’re a god because you made it so complicated nobody can understand it. That’s how they write journals in academics, they try to make it so complicated people think you’re a genius.

> The First [Friend] is the alter ego, the man who first reveals to you that you are not alone in the world by turning out (beyond hope) to share all your most secret delights. There is nothing to be overcome in making him your friend; he and you join like raindrops on a window. But the Second Friend is the man who disagrees with you about everything. He is not so much the alter ego as the antiself. Of course he shares your interests; otherwise he would not become your friend at all. But he has approached them all at a different angle. He has read all the right books but has got the wrong thing out of every one. It is as if he spoke your language but mispronounced it. How can he be so nearly right and yet, invariably, just not right? He is as fascinating (and infuriating) as a woman. When you set out to correct his heresies, you will find that he forsooth to correct yours! And then you go at it, hammer and tongs, far into the night, night after night, or walking through fine country that neither gives a glance to, each learning the weight of the other’s punches, and often more like mutually respectful enemies than friends. Actually (though it never seems so at the time) you modify one another’s thought; out of this perpetual dogfight a community of mind and a deep affection emerge.

> If you love a flower, don't pick it up. Because if you pick it up it dies, and it ceases to be what you love. So, if you love a flower, let it be. Love is not about possession; love is about appreciation.

> But no matter the medicinal virtues of being a true friend or sustaining a long close relationship with another, the ultimate touchstone of friendship is not improvement, neither of the self nor of the other, the ultimate touchstone is witness, the privilege of having ==been seen== by someone and the _equal privilege of being granted the sight of the essence_ of another, to have walked with them and to have believed in them, and sometimes just to have accompanied them for however brief a span, on a journey impossible to accomplish alone.

> David Whyte

> [[thoughts/love|Love]] is reverence, and worship, and glory, and the upward glance. Not a bandage for dirty sores. But they don't know it. Those who speak of love most promiscuously are the ones who've never felt it. They make some sort of feeble stew out of sympathy, compassion, contempt, and general indifference, and they call it love. Once you've felt what it means to love as you and I know it - total passion for the total height - you're incapable of anything less...

> the internet

> It took me most of my life to understand this: the people who care the most about you are often the ones who can hurt you the most. Not because they mean to, but because they got in. They gave you what you'd been _looking for_. But life happens. Fear creeps in. People mess up. They run, shut down, say things they don't mean or stay silent when it matters the most. And suddenly you're left questioning if it ever meant anything at all. _It did._ They cared. _Maybe still do._ But now you get to find out if they belong in your life. The ones who want to stay will _show up._ The ones who don't will _fade._

> _Marriage as a long conversation._ When entering a marriage, one should ask the question: do you think you will be able to have good conversations with this woman right into old age? Everything else in marriage is transitory, but most of the time in interaction is spent in conversation.
>
> F. [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]

> The longer I live, the more deeply I learn that love whether we call it friendship or family or romance is the work of mirroring and magnifying each other’s light. Gentle work. Steadfast work. Life-saving work in those moments when life and shame and sorrow occlude our own light from our view, but there is still a clear-eyed loving person to beam it back. In our best moments, we are that person for another.

> James Baldwin, Nothing Personal

> I would say that free will is nothing but our conscious experience of deciding what to do, which I know I am experiencing as I write this review, and this experience is not invalidated by the reflection that physical laws made it inevitable that I would want to make these decisions.

> Reform our infantilized society.
