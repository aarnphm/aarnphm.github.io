A (mostly) up-to-date [[thoughts/Cinematography|film]], movies, shows that I have consumed, or on the watch list.

> Similar to an [[books|antilibrary]], an anti-blockbusters is a collection of movies, short films that represents the art of film-making.

Honourable mentions: [mubi](https://mubi.com/en/ca) and [a24](https://a24films.com/) are both awesome distributions and production companies that one should check out, (_if you have never heard about them_ :smiley:)
