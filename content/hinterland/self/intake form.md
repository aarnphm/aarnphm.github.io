anhedonia. there are two parts to this:

- consummatory (can you feel pleasure now?) <- hedonistic pursue
- anticipatory (can you anticipate pleasure of the future?) <- they say that this mostly linked to suicide
- with this being said, I'm not suicidal (will be detailed below reasoning and aphorism)

poly and its trope.

- recently met with a pen-pal of mine as she visited the east coast (Boston -> Toronto)
- she's a Berkeley woman (San Francisco)
- affirms a lot of convictions/plans for what I want to achieve both professionally and personally.
- her backtracked on some certain decisions we made together about moving forward, and wanting to keep communication to a minimal, whilst still being friends.
- I preemptively told my other two partners that I'm seeing currently to stop seeing them, and swarming myself with work and writing instead.
- And now, sort of sitting with myself trying to figure out how i feel, because it is very counterproductive and affect my general work.

I prefer not to discuss suicide with my therapist, mostly because I equate this ideology within the degrowth category and often find this topic dull-witted. I entertain this [idea](https://stream.aarnphm.xyz/stream/on/2025/11/13) strictly with the assumption of philosophical exercise rather than call-to-action.

- suicide is often the result of people who didn't find life worth living, therefore one would take the easy way out.
- suicide is the justification of the meaning of life.
- suicide is the ultimate escapism. Camus: Hope of another life one must “deserve” or trickery those who lives not for life itself but for some great idea that will transcend it, refine it, give it meaning, and betray it.
- i have goals and targets to achieve, in which suicide _prevents_ me from achieving such goals
- suicide decreases amount of value I can contribute to society
- Therefore, suicide is **NOT** an answer, rather a cowards' solution to the absurdity of life.
- See more of my [analysis](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/Camus#analysis) on this topic.

I want a **contrarian** partner who would challenge/question my decisions/thought traces. In the past I find therapist tend to pattern-match becomes stochastic parrots (no offense), which makes the conversation very unproductive.

- I don't expect you to know about topics I think about on the daily, but i would like if you have some sense/understanding about the overall picture.
  - It is unreasonable to ask professionals/social workers to be in the weeds on these pursuits. This is what I do, and spend most of my days working on these topics.
- I think a lot about [LLMs](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/LLMs) optimization (what to make models run fast and cheap to end users) and interpretability of such systems (learning about model internal mechanism for edification purposes, think about having a wrench to fix your car). I have some [research](https://aarnphm.xyz/research) I'm currently working on.
  - reaching singularity and post-capitalism hinges on how we would solve superintelligence, and this equates to well-aligned systems with correct deontological values that aligns with pro-humanism (fwiw scaling intelligence is more of an engineering problem). We are at the precipice of building something very beautiful here. I'm not much of a doomers,X-AI risk, et al, but having a well-aligned system will never hurt.
- I also read philosophy and particularly interested in the branch of analytics [philosophy](https://aarnphm.xyz/personality#philosophical-beliefs). I'm largely influenced by the work of Wittgenstein and the movement of how we depict the state of affair through language and proposition logics. I also read quite a bit of continental philosophy (including Kierkegaard, Nietzche, and Husserl) on phenomenology and existentialism, which also forms a lot of my initial understanding on moral frameworks and [functionalism](https://aarnphm.xyz/thoughts/functionalism). I also find that a lot of these continental philosophy also influence a lot of analytical philosophy later on.
- I also have a [date-me doc](https://d.aarnphm.xyz) that I shared with previous therapist as a way to learn more about [me](https://aarnphm.xyz/dating/slides#slide-1) and what I like [doing](https://aarnphm.xyz/dating/slides#slide-4). In a sense, finding a therapist is pretty much similar to finding a date, just operating on different [subspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_subspace) with different [bases](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)>).

I live a pretty healthy life (albeit can be improved on the sleep side, we can talk more during session), in terms of working out, eat well, cook and work. But i want some more tools to regulate emotions need.

- But I do ponder about relationships.
- I envy the rationalist part of my brain, but sometimes these emotions took over and I found myself getting loss within it.

Most of my "second brains" are on the internet (you can find it here https://aarnphm.xyz/), so completely an open book. I write mostly for myself, but my friends often said that I could become a professional writer if I want to (probably not for now, because I care more about building software atm, and having a farm in near future.)
I think I'm a pretty reasonable human, and know what I want most of the time. I have a decent life, but sometimes find it hard to navigate my emotions, partly because I left home to study abroad pretty early on (when I was 16, and my parent sent me to a all-boy boarding school in Vancouver). In retrospect, my parents always told me they regretted this decision, whereas for me I think this is a canonical point in my life that they sent me early to let me figure things out myself.
