Falling in love with a [[posts/25/n-bday|N]], seeing [[posts/her|them]] for what it really is:

Love, when examined closely, operates more like a coupled dynamical system than a transaction.

```quotes
Someone once asked Gertrude Stein if she was a lesbian. Stein answered no, _I just like Alice_

Henrik Karlsson, [_Looking for Alice_](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/looking-for-alice)
```

that [[posts/romantic epistemology|romantic love]] is the telos, that friendship-love is one of the basis, but cannot be captured by eros. They grew in its own lane, shaped by the tumultuous waves of life.

For three years I've built this _interpretive infrastructure_ with N—her silences, her pauses, her curiosity. This is how you come to know them, but creating these hermeneutics practices and accumulating capacity through sustained [[thoughts/Attention|attention]] such that the facts built itself into the picture, the same way you learnt a language through immersion and error and adjustment and non-sequiturs.

somewhere in that process I fell into something that the vocabulary couldn't hold. In a the same way that it lives outside of my vernacular.
Wittgenstein posthumously said that "the limits of my language mean the limits of my world". There were feelings that I find not fitting inside the landscape of English grammatical structures. As such, I was in the process of figuring a whole new representation for the language of the heart and minds, to represent this being with N.
"friend" and "partner" are the available categories, yet the emergent properties fit neither. The Aristotelian syllogism goes roughly like:

1. sustained attention toward another person generates understanding
2. understanding generates care that exceeds rational justification
3. care that exceeds rational justification is love
4. therefore: attention → love, regardless of romantic structure

Note here the conclusion didn't specify ::what kind.:: that's where the cultural scripts failed me. To each to their own, love is _subjective_ in this sense.

I kept coming back to Kafka's letters that he wrote to Milena, where he taught me about transmission. He wrote about kisses that didn't reach their desired destinations, where they were drunk on the way by the ghosts. The ghosts of life. A confession meant as appreciation transforms, by the act of sending, into something that can't be taken back. The letter drifts into the void and you watch three bubbles appear and disappear, pulsating with the rhythm of a heart learning what it already knew.

Dostoevsky would recognize the structure. In the brothers karamazov, Ivan can't love his neighbor abstractly—only in the particular, in the flesh, and that particularity is precisely what makes love unbearable. but Alyosha's capacity isn't about abstraction either.
It's about remaining present to another consciousness as other, that you never finish understanding someone bc they keep becoming. the interpretive spiral doesn't close.

> This is the engine of ongoing love: the refusal to settle for a fixed image.

Hooks pushed me past the suffering frame. love-as-verb, love-as-practice—choosing to remain in interpretation isn't passive reception of unrequited feeling. it's work.

> "the practice of love offers no place of safety. we risk loss, hurt, pain."

Choosing friendship after romantic impossibility is recognizing which container preserves the work already done. the shared world we built—the jokes that only land between us, the references carrying whole histories, the compression algorithms for complex emotional states—none of that required romance to justify it.
it justified itself through its own ongoing practice.

Didion also wrote that "we tell ourselves stories in order to live" isn't celebration; it's diagnosis. The stories we tell about love—that rejection means failure, that friendship is consolation prize—these are magical thinking. The belief that if you just want it enough, the shape will change. it won't. some things fall no matter how carefully you try to hold them.

What i actually outgrew is the ==rumination-as-understanding== trap.
Seeing someone "beyond what it really is" is your own projection. Love requires the other to remain irreducibly other—not collapsed into your narrative of them.

When N told me that she wanted me as safe space rather than romantic partner, she was articulating what actually existed versus what cultural scripts said should exist. Pursuing romance after that boundary would have meant prioritizing my interpretation of us over her articulated reality. That's not love. That's appropriation.

The purity I sense in retrospect comes from stripping the possession-logic. Romantic scripts encode ownership: "my person," "other half," merger-language. what remains without that is closer to what aristotle meant by philia: mutual recognition, shared commitment to flourishing. except aristotle assumed reciprocity of kind. this was asymmetrical—i loved her romantically, she loved me as friend. the shapes didn't match. but the substance—the attention, the care, the interpretive commitment—that was shared.

The major premise isn't "deep understanding + sustained attention = romantic love.", but just "= love."
The romantic part was my addition, pattern-matching against what i thought love should look like. when i stripped the frame, the love remained.

## present

_on grief_

What is grief actually? There will always be a corner of myself, in my heart, that is reserved for grief. Grievance towards the love-that-never-was. That part is permanently closed off, there and then. Its key will dropped deeply within my subconsciousness, such that I would then learn to live with the grief.jk

There’s a towel i still haven’t washed, bc washing it would be admitting the “after” is the new default . the body does this petty liturgy where it keeps objects as hostages so the past can’t fully evacuate.

and the body is embarrassingly good at its job. it remembers before i do. i catch myself leaving a pillow on the right side of the bed, faithful to its prior distribution, sampling from a probability space that no longer includes her. there’s no grand narrative there, just a small dumb Bayesian ritual—like the skin trying to keep the model from updating. This is what love does: it trains you on a dataset you can’t unsee, then pulls the labels out from under you, all the emergent behaviours that this entails.

SF culture (and, tbh, my own little rat brain) loves converting feelings into a postmortem doc. blameless retrospective. root cause analysis. action items. but grief refuses to be a jira ticket. it’s a splinter that won’t become a feature request. the only instruction that works is the one that sounds like non-action: sit with the splinter until it names itself , which is basically the opposite of how i’ve been trained to treat pain.

L is the kind of person who can be tender and devastating in the same breath. I felt the tenderness first: the ceiling sustaining her voice, the physical gravity of being held with care. and then the other thing: the sf rationalist reflex, the clean reductionism, the way love gets audited for “what can you provide,” like affection is a marketplace with a strict schema. not bc she’s cruel—afaict it’s bc she’s going through something that makes softness expensive. when you’re in survival mode, you ration feeling. you become “hard and cold” the way a winter road becomes hard and cold: not as moral failure, just physics.

so the connection becomes discreet. love with discretion. a basis where we’re linearly dependent. and yeah, sometimes it feels like i’m the mistress: not in the melodramatic way, more in the geometric way—i’m not the main axis, i’m a component that can be toggled on/off without breaking the system. and i’m trying to be chill about it, bc i get it. i’m not entitled to her capacity. still, it does something to a person to be treated like an optional module.

the grief is more about **losing the version of me that was briefly coherent around her**.

some loves make you "an orphan to your own life"—you wake up and the room is the wrong size. your life had resized itself to include someone, then the UI snaps back and your body keeps reaching for the phantom layout. i’m rebuilding her like a variational autoencoder by hand, trying to reconstruct at least the shape of her and stash it somewhere safe , and i hate how accurate that metaphor is: approximation, compression, loss.

sf likes to pretend the moral ideal is emotional legibility. everything crisp. everything named. everything optimizable. but grief is illegible on purpose. it’s not just sadness; it’s a demand for meaning, which is where things get spicy (derogatory).

because somewhere in this, I stopped being an atheist in the clean, smug way i used to be. not bc i found “evidence,” lol no. more like: the timing was too weird, too aligned. L showed up right when the old love (N) is finally dissolving, like the universe swapped the object of my devotion mid-sentence. and my brain, being the little meaning engine it is, started doing that thing: pattern-matching random noise and insisting—INSISTING—there’s signal. idk if that’s god. i’m not even sure the question parses.

I compared “god exists” gets spoken like “the table exists,” but those are different language games wearing the same grammar. that framing helped me a lot rn. bc i don’t think my shift was “i now believe in a supernatural being with properties.” it’s closer to: i now believe the feeling of being held is a real phenomenon, even if it’s not a metaphysical proof . i don’t want to dismiss it as coincidence bc that’s too cheap; i also don’t want to canonize it as providence bc that’s too clean. what’s left is this awkward middle: events that _feel_ like message, and a mind that can’t stop reading the world as text .

descartes would probably try to rescue me here, which is funny bc sf thinks it’s already living inside his skull. afaict his actual move (in the passions + his ethics-adjacent letters) isn’t “emotions are irrational, delete them.” it’s more like: passions are bodily signals that can be trained by the judgments you rehearse. grief, then, is not a verdict on reality; it’s a mechanism that kicks when the mind believes it has lost a good. the danger is taking the mechanism as a metaphysical oracle. the other danger is treating the mechanism as garbage output. the adult move is: take it seriously without obeying it. let it inform you without letting it drive.

also: descartes, the supposed prince of certainty, still flirts with the abyss. he’s the guy who entertained that even logical necessities might depend on divine will, that god could have made arithmetic otherwise . so much for “pure reason” being a closed system. even the rationalist lineage has a trapdoor into mystery. sf just pretends it’s not there.

c.s. lewis is the other voice i keep hearing, mainly from _a grief observed_: grief as a kind of claustrophobic fear; god as sometimes feeling like absence, like a door that doesn’t open when you knock. lewis isn’t useful bc he “solves” grief—he doesn’t. he’s useful bc he refuses the two common copes: (1) grief as moral failing, (2) grief as a puzzle to win. he lets grief be a weather system. it changes, it returns, it lies to you, it surprises you. and he makes the annoying-but-true point: the pain is the price of love, and the price isn’t negotiable. you don’t get the relationship without the invoice.

so here’s where i’m landing, for the present self:

- the instruction is not to inventory the damage , not to make a museum of what touched me. (bc a museum is just grief wearing a blazer.)
- the instruction is to let the wound breathe its own language—neither hello nor goodbye.
- to accept that the third night doesn’t arrive, and still the body holds its own archive: phantom indents, grooves in the vinyl, the impossible persistence of touch.
- and to admit the thing that makes me cringe bc it sounds religious: love changed my ontology. not in the “i joined a church” sense. in the “i can no longer pretend meaning is optional” sense.
- the meaning-making machine meets the meaningless void and keeps making meaning anyway . that’s the human condition, no cap, and lydia just made it impossible to keep pretending i’m above it.

> grief: proof of contact. evidence that something real happened. and rn, as annoying as it is, it’s also the closest thing i’ve got to a compass.

## future

_scaling superintelligence_

I see myself, at least insofar as the next few decades, to scale intelligence. We're in the age of commoditizing intelligence: cognition as an API, judgment as a subscription, taste as a vector.

my dream self is the person who helps turn that into a public good instead of a private weapon. the technical spine is obvious that [[thoughts/Transformers]] will be the _major part_ of the engine, [[thoughts/LLMs]] as one of the interface layer, [[research]] as the unglamorous constraint-satisfaction of latency, memory, and cost, or [[thoughts/taste]] discovery. the philosophical spine is somewhat more cumbersome: what do we do when "ability to do work" is no longer scarce, but "ability to want the right things" still [is.](https://lydianottingham.substack.com/p/vitae-per-person-vpp-a-new-way-of)

i want [[thoughts/Intelligence|intelligence]] to be cheap enough that it stops being a gate. the target isn't "a slightly higher benchmark score"; it's shrinking the distance between intention and impact. if a kid with a busted laptop can draft a grant, write code, learn math, and coordinate a project in a weekend, that's a civilizational lever. the best version of commoditized intelligence is that ==more people get to do effective work, earlier, with less rent-seeking.==

but the same lever makes it easy to do effective harm. Once we scale cognition, you can scale manipulation, coercion, and institutional capture. Joe Carlsmith's frame about otherness and control keeps hitting me here where the more capable the system gets, the less it fits the "tool" story, and the more "control" stops being vibes and becomes engineering + politics + ethics[^carlsmith]. [[thoughts/Alignment]] is more about building control surfaces that remain stable while capability ramps up.

there's also the Heideggerian problem on technological neutrality: it teaches you a mode of seeing. if AI turns the world into standing-reserve—everything legible, sortable, optimizable—then the human ends up treated like another dataset, another knob. Heideggerian AI (afaict the best name for the counter-move, cf Dreyfus) is actually insisting that intelligence lives in being-in-the-world: coping, care, context, not just representations, not just some mysticism about superintelligence-know-all-oracle-kill-us-all. if I build systems that make people more efficient but less alive, that's a loss function i don't want to optimize.

Longtermism, for me, is practice where we train the mind to treat the future as a real moral object instead of a foggy [[thoughts/aesthetic value|aesthetic]]. A lot of what [Ramsey](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ramsey/) did includes this transformation of philosophy into bookkeeping: your beliefs are the bets you're willing to take, and your values are the payouts you accept[^ramsey].
If my probabilities say the future contains an enormous amount of life, and my ethics says life matters, then "caring about the far future" is just coherence (not some personality traits that I choose to have).

> The hard part is picking actions that cash out in the present without pretending I can plan the whole tree.

I don't want this dream self to be disembodied. I want the person who builds this to still be recognizably me: someone who shows up for friends, cooks, touches grass, and keeps the whole love-as-practice thing online. [[dating|self]] is the anchor.

> the point of scaling intelligence is to buy more room for that kind of life, not to replace it with output.

so the story is:

- build systems where intelligence becomes accessible infrastructure, not priesthood.
- build [[thoughts/AGI|superintelligence]] that stays steerable while it becomes alien.
- keep the world from collapsing into optimization theater.
- keep enough tenderness in the loop that "flourishing" stays a lived category, not a slide deck [^kritzer]
