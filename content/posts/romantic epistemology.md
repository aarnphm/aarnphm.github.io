_alternative: love is rlhf-ing your saliency map_

There are two types of love:

- Type I: exploration of common interests that leads to common outcomes/results/connections to achieve a common goal (procreation, happiness)
- Type II: convictions from formative experience that developed from personal tastes/[[thoughts/aesthetic value|aesthetic]] to determine ones' relationship to another human being.

draft:

you meet someone and within hours the world reorganizes around them. conversations extend past midnight, silences become comfortable, you notice how they hold their coffee cup. something shifts—not gradually but suddenly, like aspect-dawning. the duck becomes a rabbit. {{sidenotes[reorganization]: i've watched friends describe this moment and it's always the same disorientation. they'll say "we just talked about books for three hours" as if that explains anything, as if everyone doesn't talk about books. what they mean is: the ordinary became charged. sitting on a park bench felt more significant than their last vacation. the reorganization isn't about the person—it's about how the world appears when filtered through thinking about them.}}

what is this? the intensity demands explanation. {{sidenotes[rationalization]: there's something desperate about this impulse. you're trying to protect yourself—if you understand the mechanism, maybe you can control it, predict when it will end, prepare for disappointment. but also: the rationalization is a way of staying with the feeling. you keep dissecting it because you want to remain in contact with something that resists your usual frameworks.}} how can a few hours with someone you barely know feel more real than relationships you've maintained for years?

## two ways to love

i've noticed people talk about relationships in two distinct registers that don't quite map onto each other.

some describe love as coordinating on shared projects. building a life together, raising children, supporting each other's work. this is aristotelian friendship of utility—you date someone because they help you achieve goals. compatible life plans, overlapping values, shared interests. @kant1785groundwork called these hypothetical imperatives: if you want X (children, happiness, security), then date someone compatible. the relationship is instrumentally rational, serves purposes outside itself.

dating apps optimize for this. education, politics, location, timeline for marriage. you swipe through profiles looking for specification matches. the language reveals the logic: "not looking for a pen pal" means justify your roi quickly. "what are you looking for" on a first date asks whether your product-market fit aligns. {{sidenotes[optimization]: there's something revealing about how people talk about relationships on dating apps. "i'm not looking for a pen pal" means "justify your roi quickly." "what are you looking for" on a first date is really asking "do our specifications match." the language is borrowed from product-market fit, and it's not just metaphor—people actually relate to potential partners as portfolio decisions. calculate expected value, minimize downside risk, diversify options.}} calculate expected value, minimize downside risk, diversify your options.

this can be genuine. procreation, companionship, building something together—these are real goods. but they're consequentialist. the love gets justified by its outcomes.

then there's something else. people stay in relationships that make no sense from outside. the shared goals dissolved, the daily friction is obvious, friends can't understand why they don't leave. {{sidenotes[volitional-necessity]: i've watched people stay in relationships that make no sense from the outside. their partner changed, the shared goals dissolved, the daily friction is obvious. but leaving would require becoming someone else—not just changing their situation but violating something constitutive. this looks like stubbornness or sunken cost fallacy, but it's different. they're not trapped—they're expressing who they are by remaining.}} but leaving would require becoming someone else—not just changing their situation but violating something constitutive of who they are.

@kierkegaard1847worksoflove called this love as duty you give yourself. "you shall love" makes love free—it's independent of the object's behavior. not duty imposed from outside but duty you choose. they can change; you chose this, you remain.

@frankfurt1988necessity: love creates volitional necessity. you could physically leave them. but doing so would violate something about who you are. the necessity is normative, not causal.

this is love as expression rather than instrument. you love them because of who you are, not what they provide. your formative experiences, your aesthetic tastes, your idiosyncratic way of making sense determine who you can love. {{sidenotes[conviction]: there's something you recognize in certain people that has nothing to do with compatibility metrics. maybe they move through the world in a way that resonates with your own formative experiences. maybe their way of being attentive mirrors something you value but can't articulate. this isn't about shared interests or life goals—it's about aesthetic fit at a deeper level. you can't explain to friends why you're drawn to them because the reasons aren't legible as reasons.}} you recognize something in them that has nothing to do with compatibility metrics. when friends ask why you're drawn to them, the reasons aren't legible as reasons.

most relationships involve both. you have shared goals and conviction-based attachment. but modernity keeps trying to reduce the second to the first. {{sidenotes[reduction]: there's a moment in therapy culture when someone realizes their relationship doesn't "serve their growth" or "meet their needs," and suddenly they're applying cost-benefit analysis to conviction. the language of self-optimization—"i deserve better," "they're not showing up for me"—treats type II love as irrational attachment you should overcome. sometimes this is right. but sometimes you're dissolving something real because you've accepted the premise that love should be instrumentally justified.}} therapy culture asks if the relationship "serves your growth" or "meets your needs," applying cost-benefit analysis to conviction. the language of self-optimization—"i deserve better," "they're not showing up for me"—treats conviction as irrational attachment you should overcome. sometimes this is right. but sometimes you're dissolving something real because you've accepted that love should be instrumentally justified.

"i love them because they make me happy" instrumentalizes conviction as utility-maximization. happiness becomes the metric. if they stop making you happy, the relationship fails cost-benefit analysis.

but conviction persists despite unhappiness, goal-failure, incompatibility. @camus: the misery and greatness of this world—it offers no truths, but only objects for love. absurdity is king, but love saves us from it. {{sidenotes[absurdist-love]: there's something camus understood about staying with someone not because it makes sense but because the alternative—living without them—renders your own life senseless. not romantic in the greeting card way. more like: you're building meaning in a meaningless universe, and they're woven into that meaning-making. removing them would unravel the structure.}}

## what the distinction misses

the goal-oriented versus conviction-based distinction captures something real about how people relate to relationships. but it doesn't explain what happens inside them.

i know someone who dated a person for two years where they understood each other completely. {{sidenotes[pattern-a-lived]: they could talk for hours, understood each other's frameworks completely, felt more known by this person than anyone else. but one wanted to move to a different country for work, the other was tied to their family. one wanted children, the other was ambivalent. they kept saying "we'll figure it out" but the trajectories were incompatible. eventually they chose the futures they'd projected before meeting, but the loss was real—not just losing a partner but losing the person who understood them best.}} they could talk for hours, felt more known by this person than anyone else. but one wanted to move to a different country for work, the other was tied to family. one wanted children, the other was ambivalent. they kept saying "we'll figure it out" but the trajectories were incompatible. eventually they chose the futures they'd projected before meeting. the loss was real—not just losing a partner but losing the person who understood them best.

from outside this looks like goal-oriented love (incompatible life plans, end it). but from inside, the understanding felt more fundamental than any particular life plan. {{sidenotes[type-tension-a]: the tension here is that from outside it looks obvious—incompatible life plans means end it. but from inside, the hermeneutic connection feels more fundamental than any particular life plan. you could change your goals, couldn't you? except the goals aren't arbitrary—they're tied to who you're trying to become. so you're caught between conviction (this person matters) and projection (this future matters), and there's no clean resolution.}} you could change your goals, couldn't you? except the goals aren't arbitrary—they're tied to who you're trying to become. so you're caught between conviction (this person matters) and projection (this future matters).

then i've watched people marry where everything aligns on paper—careers, location, family values, timeline. {{sidenotes[pattern-b-lived]: i've watched people marry in this configuration. on paper everything aligns—careers, location, family values, timeline. but there's a flatness to their interactions. they coordinate well but don't seem to understand each other. when conflict arises they talk past each other, both frustrated that the other "won't listen" when really they can't enter each other's frameworks. sometimes this works—they're running a household together, not seeking deep recognition. sometimes it slowly becomes lonely, living with someone who doesn't get you.}} but there's a flatness to their interactions. they coordinate well but don't seem to understand each other. when conflict arises they talk past each other, both frustrated that the other "won't listen" when really they can't enter each other's frameworks. sometimes this works—they're running a household together. sometimes it slowly becomes lonely.

or couples where the attraction is undeniable but cohabitation is constant friction. {{sidenotes[pattern-c-lived]: i know a couple where the attraction was undeniable—they'd cancel plans to see each other, the physical chemistry was obvious to everyone around them. then they moved in together and it was constant low-level conflict. one needed the apartment quiet to decompress, the other processed stress by talking. one was tidy to the point of anxiety, the other genuinely didn't see mess. the desire remained but they were exhausted by negotiating basic domestic life. eventually they went back to living separately while staying together, which solved the friction but felt like admitting failure.}} one person needs the apartment quiet to decompress, the other processes stress by talking. one is tidy to the point of anxiety, the other genuinely doesn't see mess. the desire remains but they're exhausted by negotiating basic domestic life.

these don't fit cleanly into goal-oriented versus conviction-based. something else is operating.

## dimensions that matter

watching relationships, certain dimensions keep appearing that cut across the goal/conviction distinction.

there's how you interpret and understand them. @gadamer1960truth calls this fusion of horizons: you bring your world, they bring theirs, understanding emerges where they meet. {{sidenotes[entering-frameworks]: there's a moment in early relationships where you realize you've been translating everything they say into your own categories and it's not working. they use "anxious" differently than you do. when they say they need space it means something you haven't encountered before. you have to build new interpretive equipment, and this is exhausting in a specific way—not like learning facts but like learning to see.}} but this isn't about knowing facts about them. it's about entering their framework of meaning. they use "anxious" differently than you do. when they say they need space it means something you haven't encountered before. you have to build new interpretive equipment.

this is continuous work. you interpret them, check interpretations against their responses, revise, re-interpret. the circle never closes. {{sidenotes[misunderstanding]: i've noticed that misunderstandings in relationships rarely stem from lack of information. you can know someone's childhood traumas, their triggers, their patterns—and still retreat to "they're just being irrational" when interpretation becomes difficult. the circle breaks not from ignorance but from refusal to keep trying. you give up on charitable interpretation because it's easier to categorize them as unreasonable than to revise your framework again.}} when someone says "you don't understand me," they're right—understanding must be renewed. misunderstandings rarely stem from lack of information. you can know someone's childhood traumas, their triggers, their patterns—and still retreat to "they're just being irrational" when interpretation becomes difficult. the circle breaks from refusal to keep trying.

@anderson2023hermeneutics identifies this as hermeneutic labor: the burden of interpreting your own feelings and the feelings of others. in heteronormative dynamics this labor is gendered. women decode male silence, construct coherent narratives for the couple, maintain the interpretive framework that holds the relationship together.

then there's embodied desire. @fisher2004why identifies three distinct neural systems: lust (androgens, estrogens), attraction (dopamine, low serotonin), attachment (oxytocin, vasopressin). these operate independently. {{sidenotes[desire-direction]: there's a specific disorientation when desire and understanding point in different directions. you're drawn to someone whose framework you can't enter, or you understand someone deeply but feel no pull. i've seen people try to rationalize their way into attraction—"they're perfect on paper, i should want this"—and it never works. the body has its own logic and won't be argued with.}} you can feel intense attraction without attachment, deep attachment without lust. desire and understanding can point in different directions. people try to rationalize their way into attraction—"they're perfect on paper, i should want this"—and it never works.

@merleau-ponty1945phenomenology: the body as both subject and object, touching while being touched. in desire you're not a transparent consciousness observing another body. you're flesh encountering flesh, reversibility all the way down.

@schopenhauer1844world saw this more darkly: love as the will's deception. the intensity you feel isn't about this particular person—it's the blind will-to-life ensuring reproduction. once the biological aim is achieved, the beloved becomes ordinary.

then there's shared material life. who cooks breakfast, how you negotiate bathroom time, whether you can work in the same room. {{sidenotes[domestic-friction]: i've watched couples negotiate this and the friction points are never what you'd predict. it's not about money or chores in the abstract. it's that one person needs the kitchen clean before they can relax and the other doesn't see dishes as mess. one person processes the day by talking and the other needs silence first. these aren't preferences you discuss on dates—they're structural differences in how you inhabit space and time.}} @beauvoir1949second: the concrete economic and social entanglement that structures possibilities. friction points are never what you'd predict. it's not about money or chores in the abstract. it's that one person needs the kitchen clean before they can relax and the other doesn't see dishes as mess. these aren't preferences you discuss on dates—they're structural differences in how you inhabit space and time.

@gilligan1982different, @noddings1984caring: particularity over universality, relational self over autonomous individual, context-sensitive responsiveness. you don't love "humanity"—you love this person in this kitchen on this morning when they're irritable before coffee.

living together is posteriori verification of the model you built during courtship. {{sidenotes[verification]: there's a pattern where people move in together and within weeks realize they've been dating a projection. the person who seemed easygoing is actually conflict-avoidant. the person who seemed independent is actually avoiding intimacy. you built your hermeneutic model from limited data—weekends, dates, best-behavior interactions. cohabitation floods you with data that doesn't fit, and you have to rebuild the model or admit you don't understand them at all.}} people move in together and within weeks realize they've been dating a projection. the person who seemed easygoing is actually conflict-avoidant. the person who seemed independent is avoiding intimacy. you built your model from limited data—weekends, dates, best-behavior interactions. cohabitation floods you with data that doesn't fit.

and there's temporal projection. who do you want to become? what life do you want to build? @sartre1943being: you're always projecting possibilities. your for-itself is defined by not-yet-ness, by the future you're choosing. {{sidenotes[trajectory-divergence]: i've seen relationships end not because anything was wrong now but because the futures didn't align. one person wants to move back to their hometown, the other's career requires staying in the city. one wants children within three years, the other isn't sure they ever want them. you can love someone intensely in the present while knowing your projected trajectories diverge. the question is whether the present connection justifies abandoning your imagined future.}} relationships end not because anything is wrong now but because futures don't align. one person wants to move back to their hometown, the other's career requires staying in the city. you can love someone intensely in the present while knowing your projected trajectories diverge.

but also: economic realities. marriage as contract, inheritance, child-rearing. @illouz2007cold describes how modern love gets colonized by emotional capitalism. dating apps quantify compatibility. therapy discourse rationalizes desire. love becomes cold intimacy—optimized, evaluated, stripped of ambiguity.

these dimensions interpenetrate. {{sidenotes[interpenetration]: i've noticed how understanding someone changes what you find attractive about them. you learn they're anxious about their work and suddenly their intensity feels protective rather than aggressive. or the reverse—you're attracted to someone until you understand the framework driving their behavior, then the attraction collapses. the boxes aren't independent variables you can adjust separately. they're dimensions of a single phenomenon, and changing one reshapes the others.}} understanding someone changes what you find attractive about them. you learn they're anxious about their work and suddenly their intensity feels protective rather than aggressive. or the reverse—you're attracted to someone until you understand the framework driving their behavior, then the attraction collapses. passion influences how you interpret them. cohabitation reveals gaps in your future-projections.

@sternberg1986triangular theory of love tried to capture this with intimacy + passion + commitment. but his model decomposes love into additive components. these dimensions aren't like that. they're not independent variables you can adjust separately.

## the regulatory model

five dimensions as state variables. hermeneutics isn't parallel to the others—it's the decoder layer. without $H$, you can't read the other signals.

### hermeneutic depth ($H$)

capacity to enter their framework without reducing them to model.

**observables:** can you be surprised by them? do you update interpretations? do misunderstandings feel like puzzles (healthy) or character flaws (unhealthy)?

**threshold:** when you stop asking questions you think you know answers to. {{sidenotes[h-collapse]: you'll notice this as certainty. you're sure what they meant. you don't need to check. but certainty is the hermeneutic circle closing—which means you've stopped understanding and started modeling.}}

**intervention:** re-enter the circle. ask "what did you mean by X?" even when you're sure. check projections against their actual responses.

### embodied resonance ($E$)

fisher's three systems (lust, attraction, attachment) operating in some configuration.

**observables:** do you want physical proximity? does touch feel natural or performed?

**threshold:** when physical nearness becomes neutral or aversive without external cause (stress, illness, resentment).

**intervention:** can't will desire. remove barriers if they exist. if $E \to 0$ despite no barriers, that's data—not a problem to solve. {{sidenotes[e-brutal]: some dimensions have no fix. you can choose to stay in a relationship with low $E$ (companionate love is real) but you can't manufacture what isn't there. pretending otherwise is bad faith.}}

### material coupling ($M$)

entanglement of daily systems—space, time, logistics.

**observables:** can you coexist without friction? does logistics feel collaborative or zero-sum?

**threshold:** when negotiating basic domesticity becomes exhausting.

**intervention:** explicit contracts. separate what can be separated. reduce unnecessary contact points. {{sidenotes[m-structure]: beauvoir's insight: some incompatibilities are structural, not moral failures. one person needs silence to decompress; the other processes by talking. this isn't fixable—only manageable.}}

### temporal alignment ($T$)

convergence of projected trajectories.

**observables:** can you picture them in your future? can they picture you? do your goals require divergent paths?

**threshold:** when you can't imagine them in $t+5$ without sacrificing something constitutive.

**intervention:** identify non-negotiables vs. flexible goals. negotiate timelines. if trajectories fundamentally diverge, that's information—not failure to try hard enough. {{sidenotes[t-diverge]: the couple where one wants to move home and the other's career requires staying—their $T$ was incompatible from the start. the understanding was real. the future wasn't.}}

### recognition ($R$)

volitional act of treating them as subject (I-Thou) not object (I-It).

**observables:** do you acknowledge their perspective as valid even when disagreeing? do you weaponize your model of them?

**threshold:** when you start debugging them instead of understanding them. {{sidenotes[r-debug]: "you're just saying that because you're anxious" might be true. but it's also I-It—reducing their perspective to a symptom of their psychology rather than engaging it as meaning.}}

**intervention:** deliberately practice I-Thou stance. catch objectification in real-time. stop predicting → start asking.

## failure cascades

how dimension failures propagate:

$H \to 0$: all other signals become noise. you can't interpret whether $E$, $M$, $T$, $R$ are working. this is why hermeneutics is the decoder—without it, you're navigating blind.

$E \to 0$: companionate love possible. relationship survives but lacks charge. fine if both parties accept this. becomes pathological only when one pretends $E$ exists or demands it return.

$M \to 0$: "liquid love" (bauman). relationship can't survive logistics. viable only as long-distance or non-cohabiting. some people build meaningful connections this way—but it's a constraint, not a feature.

$T \to 0$: relationship has expiration date. can be meaningful anyway—finite games are still games. pretending otherwise is bad faith. {{sidenotes[t-zero]: knowing the relationship ends doesn't make it less real. it makes it differently real. some of the most intense connections have $T \to 0$ baked in—someone's leaving, someone's dying, someone's choosing a different future. the question is whether you can love knowing that.}}

$R \to 0$: relationship becomes instrumentalizing. you're using them. they may not notice immediately—especially if $E$ remains high. but you've exited love and entered extraction.

**compensatory dynamics:**

high $H$ can sustain relationship through low $E$ (you understand why desire faded, you choose to stay anyway). high $E$ cannot compensate for low $H$ (limerence without understanding = projection). high $M$ + high $T$ without $H$ or $R$ = sternberg's "empty love"—the form of marriage without its substance.

## type-I / type-II mapping

how dimensions map to the two types:

**type-I** (instrumental): optimizes $M$ and $T$. relationship justified by structural/temporal fit. dating apps are $M$/$T$ matching engines.

**type-II** (constitutive): anchored in $H$ and $R$. relationship justified by being seen/seeing. you stay because leaving would violate who you are, not because the logistics work.

**$E$** is orthogonal—can have high embodied resonance with either type. limerence doesn't tell you which type you're in.

the "tasteful life" trap: trying to optimize type-II aesthetically makes it type-I in disguise. {{sidenotes[tasteful-trap]: the moment you start optimizing for "authentic connection" you've instrumentalized authenticity. type-II resists optimization because it's constitutive—you don't choose it for reasons, you discover it's already chosen. trying to manufacture conviction produces its simulacrum.}}

## the hermeneutic dimension

the interpretive dimension seems to operate differently than the others.

if you reduce someone to a model—behavioral patterns, personality metrics, predictive function—you've exited the hermeneutic circle. {{sidenotes[objectification]: i've seen people do this—start cataloging their partner's patterns like debugging a system. "when they're stressed they withdraw, when they withdraw they need space, when they need space i should..." it becomes behavioral prediction rather than understanding. you're treating them as a mechanism with inputs and outputs. this can feel like progress—finally you're solving the problem—but you've lost something essential. they're no longer a person you're trying to understand but a system you're trying to manage.}} you're no longer understanding them as a person (subject with first-person givenness) but as an object (third-person system). people start cataloging their partner's patterns like debugging a system. "when they're stressed they withdraw, when they withdraw they need space, when they need space i should..." it becomes behavioral prediction rather than understanding. this can feel like progress—finally you're solving the problem—but you've lost something essential.

@wittgenstein1953investigations: the difference between knowledge and acknowledgment. @cavell1979claim develops this: skepticism in love ("do they really love me?") isn't solved by more data. it's solved by volitional act of acknowledgment—choosing to treat the other as a soul.

you can know everything about someone without acknowledging them. knowledge is propositional information (favorite color, childhood traumas, behavioral tendencies). acknowledgment is recognizing them as a subject whose first-person perspective matters. {{sidenotes[acknowledgment]: this distinction shows up in arguments. you can predict exactly what they'll say, how they'll react, what their objections will be—and still refuse to acknowledge that their perspective is valid. you're using knowledge against them, deploying your model of their psychology to dismiss rather than understand. "you're just saying that because you're anxious" might be true, but it's also refusing to enter their framework, to take seriously that from their perspective the anxiety is revealing something real.}}

this shows up in arguments. you can predict exactly what they'll say, how they'll react, what their objections will be—and still refuse to acknowledge that their perspective is valid. you're using knowledge against them. "you're just saying that because you're anxious" might be true, but it's also refusing to enter their framework, to take seriously that from their perspective the anxiety is revealing something real.

hermeneutic labor is choosing to stay in the circle despite difficulty. relationships fail from refusal to do interpretive work. you stop trying to understand them charitably. you retreat to easy categories ("they're just selfish," "they're irrational"). you give up on fusion of horizons.

passion can be misdirected if you misunderstand who they are. cohabitation becomes alienating if you don't understand their needs. future-projections fail if you're projecting onto a misinterpretation.

the hermeneutic dimension is the condition of possibility for the others. you can't love someone you don't understand—not complete understanding (impossible) but entering the circle.

## defensive rationalization

why does the impulse to rationalize emerge?

modernity is characterized by anxiety about uncertainty. we want control, prediction, optimization. love resists all three. {{sidenotes[control-anxiety]: there's a moment when you realize you're trying to understand someone not to get closer to them but to feel safer. if you can map their patterns, predict their reactions, model their psychology, then they become less threatening. the uncertainty of their otherness—that they might surprise you, hurt you, leave you—gets managed through comprehension. but this is defensive understanding, not loving understanding. you're building a model to protect yourself from them.}} @illouz2007cold: emotional capitalism tries to make love calculable. compatibility metrics, attachment theory, evolutionary psychology explanations reveal how we relate to what we can't control.

there's a moment when you realize you're trying to understand someone not to get closer to them but to feel safer. if you can map their patterns, predict their reactions, model their psychology, then they become less threatening. the uncertainty of their otherness—that they might surprise you, hurt you, leave you—gets managed through comprehension. but this is defensive understanding.

the dating app is epistemological device. it defines what counts as relevant information (photos, education, interests). it structures how you know someone (profile before person). {{sidenotes[app-epistemology]: i've watched people swipe through hundreds of profiles, making snap judgments based on carefully curated information. the app trains you to think you can know enough from a profile to decide if someone is worth meeting. but the information it surfaces—job, school, height, photos—is precisely what's least relevant to hermeneutic compatibility. you can't tell from someone's profile whether you'll be able to enter their framework, whether your horizons will fuse. the app makes you think love is matching along measurable dimensions when it's really about interpretive resonance that can't be captured in data.}} it commodifies hermeneutic labor—swipe-based filtering replaces interpretive engagement. the information it surfaces—job, school, height, photos—is precisely what's least relevant to hermeneutic compatibility. you can't tell from someone's profile whether you'll be able to enter their framework, whether your horizons will fuse.

but maybe the rationalization impulse isn't wrong—just operating at the wrong level. {{sidenotes[meta-hermeneutics]: maybe the rationalization impulse isn't wrong—it's just operating at the wrong level. you can't rationalize them into a complete model, but you can understand your own attempts to rationalize. why do you keep trying to explain this connection? what are you avoiding by analyzing rather than experiencing? the boxes model might be most useful not for understanding love but for understanding why you need to understand love. it's hermeneutics of your own hermeneutic drive.}} you can't rationalize them into a complete model, but you can understand your own attempts to rationalize. why do you keep trying to explain this connection? what are you avoiding by analyzing rather than experiencing? building models, decomposing into dimensions, analyzing patterns—this is itself a form of hermeneutic work. not understanding the person but understanding our relationship to them.

@hegel1807phenomenology: recognition as dialectical struggle. two consciousnesses meet, each wanting to be the absolute center. this creates the master-slave dialectic. the master seeks recognition without reciprocating. the slave recognizes the master but isn't recognized in return.

the master's recognition is hollow—it comes from someone he doesn't recognize as equal. the slave, through interpretive labor (understanding what the master wants, how to serve him), achieves self-consciousness the master lacks. {{sidenotes[gendered-labor]: this maps too clearly onto gendered relationship dynamics. i've seen it repeatedly—one partner (usually women) doing all the interpretive work, understanding the other's moods, needs, frameworks, maintaining the relationship's coherence. the other partner receives this understanding without reciprocating, without doing the work of entering their partner's horizon. the one doing interpretive labor develops sophisticated understanding while the one receiving it remains interpretively lazy. eventually the imbalance becomes unbearable—not because understanding is burden but because unreciprocated understanding is degrading.}}

in love: one partner often does majority of hermeneutic labor. understands the other, interprets generously, maintains the relationship's narrative coherence. this is typically gendered—women performing emotional labor for men. one partner doing all the interpretive work, understanding the other's moods, needs, frameworks. the other partner receives this understanding without reciprocating. the one doing interpretive labor develops sophisticated understanding while the one receiving it remains interpretively lazy. eventually the imbalance becomes unbearable.

@beauvoir1949second: inauthentic love occurs when the woman abdicates her transcendence, losing herself in the man to find security (becoming pure object). or the man views woman solely as vessel for his pleasure (pure subject/object relation).

authentic love requires maintaining ambiguity—both parties must experience themselves and each other as both flesh (object/immanence) and spirit (subject/transcendence) simultaneously. this is unstable. it requires continuous work.

## what resists capture

love always exceeds its explanations. @marion2007erotic: the erotic phenomenon gives itself without being summoned. it arrives as excess, saturating intention. {{sidenotes[phenomenal-excess]: there's always something about them that escapes your categories. you think you understand them, can predict them, have them mapped—then they do something that doesn't fit your model. laugh at a joke you didn't expect them to find funny. get angry about something you thought they'd dismiss. reveal a vulnerability you didn't know existed. these moments of excess are destabilizing but also what keeps the relationship alive. if you could fully comprehend them, if they never surprised you, something essential would be lost.}} you can't contain it in boxes, can't reduce it to functions. there's always something about them that escapes your categories. you think you understand them, can predict them, have them mapped—then they do something that doesn't fit. laugh at a joke you didn't expect them to find funny. reveal a vulnerability you didn't know existed. these moments of excess are destabilizing but also what keeps the relationship alive.

phenomenology recognizes this: the given always exceeds the intended. you aim at the other with your interpretive framework, your desire, your domestic arrangements, your future plans—but they overflow. they surprise you. they resist comprehension.

the dimensions are general—they apply to any relationship. but love is particular. this person, this kitchen, this morning. @murdoch1970sovereignty: moral life happens in ongoing attention, not discrete choices. how you think about someone, what you notice, what you ignore—this is where love operates. the way they laugh at their own jokes. how they apologize. what they do when they're anxious. these details resist generalization.

relationships die slowly while both people insist everything is fine. {{sidenotes[slow-death]: i've seen relationships die slowly while both people insist everything is fine. they still live together (box 3), still have sex occasionally (box 2), still share future plans (box 4). but the hermeneutic work has stopped (box 1). they've given up trying to understand each other, retreated to easy categories, stopped being curious about the other's perspective. the structure remains but something vital is missing. they're going through the motions of a relationship while the actual connection has dissolved.}} they still live together, still have sex occasionally, still share future plans. but the hermeneutic work has stopped. they've given up trying to understand each other, retreated to easy categories, stopped being curious about the other's perspective. the structure remains but something vital is missing.

@hooks2000love: love is action. {{sidenotes[love-as-verb]: bell hooks understood this—love isn't primarily a feeling but a practice. you can feel affection for someone while not loving them if you're not doing the work. attending to who they are, interpreting them generously, choosing them despite difficulty. when you stop acting lovingly the feeling eventually follows. the relationship dies from inaction before it dies from lack of feeling.}} when action stops—when you stop attending, stop interpreting charitably, stop choosing them—the relationship dies. but this can happen while the structure remains. going through motions without engagement. love isn't primarily a feeling but a practice. when you stop acting lovingly the feeling eventually follows.

people aren't static. they change—through experience, through relationship itself, through time. your understanding must be continuously renewed. the person you understood yesterday isn't identical to the person today. @ricoeur1992oneself: narrative identity. you understand someone by understanding their story—not just facts but how they make sense of facts, what trajectory they see, what possibilities matter. but the story keeps going. new chapters complicate earlier ones.

## staying with perplexity

the impulse to rationalize intimate connection produces these distinctions—goal-oriented versus conviction-based, interpretive versus embodied versus material versus temporal. they help. they let you see structure, identify tensions, recognize failure modes.

but the framework creates problems. {{sidenotes[analytic-distance]: there's a moment when rationalization crosses a line. you've been analyzing your relationship, trying to understand why it works or doesn't work, mapping the patterns—and you realize you're no longer in the relationship but observing it. you've created distance between yourself and the experience. what started as trying to understand them better has become avoiding the vulnerability of just being with them without comprehension. the analysis protects you from the risk of presence.}} reducing love to dimensions risks destroying what you're studying. the attempt to understand becomes obstacle to understanding. you can't love someone you've made into object of analysis. there's a moment when rationalization crosses a line. you've been analyzing your relationship, mapping the patterns—and you realize you're no longer in the relationship but observing it. you've created distance between yourself and the experience. analysis protects you from the risk of presence.

yet we keep trying. maybe this is the condition: we're beings who need to understand but whose understanding is always incomplete. {{sidenotes[incompleteness]: i've noticed that the people most insistent on understanding love completely are often the most defended against it. as if comprehensive understanding would make them safe, would let them love without risk. but the incompleteness isn't a bug—it's fundamental. you can't love someone you fully understand because full understanding would mean they're no longer other, no longer surprising, no longer capable of exceeding your categories. the gap between your understanding and who they are is where the relationship lives.}} the hermeneutic circle doesn't close. we interpret, revise, re-interpret, never arriving at final meaning. people most insistent on understanding love completely are often the most defended against it. as if comprehensive understanding would make them safe, would let them love without risk. but you can't love someone you fully understand because full understanding would mean they're no longer other, no longer surprising, no longer capable of exceeding your categories. the gap between your understanding and who they are is where the relationship lives.

@gadamer1960truth: understanding is not method that guarantees results. it's event that happens to you. you can prepare for it (bracket prejudices, stay open, attend carefully) but you can't force it. fusion of horizons isn't achieved—it occurs.

love might be like this. not achievement but occurrence. not state you reach but process you stay in. {{sidenotes[processual-love]: there's a shift that happens when you stop thinking about love as something you have or don't have and start thinking about it as something you're doing or not doing. the question changes from "do i love them?" to "am i loving them?" from state to practice. this makes it less stable—you can't just declare love and be done—but more honest. love isn't something you achieve and maintain. it's something you keep choosing, keep enacting, keep returning to.}} the question changes from "do i love them?" to "am i loving them?" from state to practice. this makes it less stable—you can't just declare love and be done—but more honest. love isn't something you achieve and maintain. it's something you keep choosing, keep enacting, keep returning to.

you meet someone and the world reorganizes. you want to understand why. you build models, decompose into dimensions, analyze patterns. the models help identify where to direct attention, what needs work, how things might go wrong. but they can't substitute for the work itself: staying in the hermeneutic circle, attending to who they are, choosing them despite uncertainty.

rationalization doesn't resolve the perplexity—it lets you stay with it. building these frameworks is how you engage with what resists explanation. not to master it but to remain in relation to it. understanding that you don't understand, and choosing anyway. {{sidenotes[staying-with]: the perplexity doesn't go away. you can build increasingly sophisticated models, read more philosophy, analyze more patterns—and you're still left with the fundamental mystery of why this person, why now, why does it feel like this. but maybe staying with the perplexity is the right response. not trying to eliminate uncertainty but learning to love alongside it. the boxes model isn't solving the problem—it's giving you something to do with your hands while you sit with what can't be solved.}}
