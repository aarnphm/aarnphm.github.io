ad abundantiam

<div style="font-style: italic">

preamble: the initial intention for this piece was to argue "against happiness" as a 2025 review, however, I have then shifted this to be standalone argument against abundance—specifically about how multiplication of external causes (connections, access-to-everything, interconnectedness) has substantially improved my quality of life yet somehow intensified a particular kind of grief. What emerges from these inverse phenomenon turned out to be quite cathartic: when nothing is necessary, and everything is available, what matters the most?

This essay is about _hyperabudance_, or on the grief of capturing one's taste onto a compressed latent space. I imagine this to be one of the bases for living in a post-scarcity world.

See [[posts/2025-lists|this list instead]] for canon events in 2025, which I find it to be more personal/aligned with previous years.

![[posts/images/the-embrace-egon-schiele.webp|The Embrace, Egon Schiele (1917)]]

Schiele painted this a year before his death. The oil shows two bodies clinging to each other in a way that reads less as tenderness but more as structural necessity—load-bearing elements rather than ornaments, as though trying to tear out _even just_ a sliver of one would disintegrate the integrity of both completely. They became each other's architecture. [^schiele]

Most read the painting as Schiele's portrait of sacred love for Edith [^edith], yet for me it poses a question i spent most of 2025 trying to answer: _what does it mean to REQUIRE someone—to manufacture necessity for each other—in a world where nothing is required?_ Gone the [[posts/yearn|yearning]] to be loved, gone the "salt-pillared stories that buttress that theater in my head" [^sn], gone the lust of aesthetic satisfaction, and in its place, only the unedited fact of being-together-as-default-state. For two people to stop performing the _act of intimacy_. For two people stop pretending, and just _be_.

The bodies in the painting require each other the way walls require foundations. And Schiele couldn't have known, standing at his easel, that the flu would prove him right—that when one structure fell, the other would follow within seventy-two hours. As if the painting had been an equation all along. In the same way that Sherry wrote about belonging:

```quotes
If summer is for summoning what you desire, then winter is for becoming what you endure. Maybe I do believe in the effects of mercury retrograde, maybe I don’t. But what I like about it is that it makes me feel like I live in a magical universe. How comforting is it to think that there are recurring pullbacks in nature, that taking a step back is necessary for the next leap forward?

SN, [And the sun stood still](https://www.sherryning.com/p/and-the-sun-stood-still)
```

[^sn]: Sherry Ning, [I want a boyfriend](https://www.sherryning.com/p/i-want-a-boyfriend)

[^edith]: Schiele and Edith married in 1915. She was 23 when she died, _six months pregnant_. He was 28. The gap between their deaths—three days—is almost too literary to be true.

[^schiele]:
    Schiele's figures are famously non-idealised. The angularity combines eroticism and mortality into a single gesture—he understood that [[thoughts/love]] isn't separable from its own precarity. Spinoza formulated love as "joy accompanied by the idea of an external cause." The external cause is the key. Anything external can be lost. And will be lost.

    This makes imminence-of-loss a constitutive feature of love rather than an unfortunate side effect—the structure that makes love-joy categorically distinct from self-generated satisfactions. _You can't lose what was never outside you._

I hate using polysyllabic terms, but hyperabundance goes by many names: post-scarcity, multiplicity, paradox of choice, {{sidenotes[singularity.]: This is a bit of a reach, but the argument for technological singularity implies a post-scarcity world.}} Roughly, it is the mental state where infinite availability of high-quality options renders _optimization_ impossible, forcing a shift from _objective valuation_ to _subjective resonance_ [^gemini]

We often fall into this trap of paralysis—surrounded by [[thoughts/multiplicity]] but feeling a distinct lack, perhaps the grief of lost constraints. The emergent pattern I notice through and through is that **constraint constitutes identity**, as such ==hyperabundance promotes an eternal state of emptiness==. The same operation that generates abundance generates dissolution simultaneously, as dual aspects of one transformation.

I also believe the emptiness I felt was manifested from a personal rebellion against building [_my ghost_](https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/animals-vs-ghosts/)—ghosts as crystallized identities stable across time. hyperabundance prevents ghost-building because identity keeps shifting with context, and the ghost requires static friction to solidify.

\*\*\*

If we look closely into the metaphysics of identity, we find [[thoughts/Sphinoza]]'s {{sidenotes[omnis determinatio est negatio.]: all determination is negation. This is then later universalized by Hegel in _Die Naturphilosophie mit den mündlichen Zusätzen_ (Encyclopedia Logic): "The basis of all determinacy is negation".}} For anything to have specific identity, it _must_ exclude other possibilities. From a functionalist POV, being $X$ necessarily means not-being $Y, Z$ and everything else—identity presupposes an {{sidenotes[upper-bound]: updated based on lived experience}} for limitation; without it, only undifferentiated potentiality. Saussure radicalised this for language:

```quotes
In language there are only differences without positive terms.

Ferdinand de Saussure, _Course in General Linguistics_
```

We know green because it is not blue, not yellow. Derrida extended this through _différance_—"every signified is also in the position of a signifier"—meaning endlessly defers through chains of exclusion. Identity formation ==presupposes the scarcity of possibility==.

In scarcity regimes, identity was objective: a hammer is a hammer bc its structure precludes being a pillow. you can trust that the hammer remains a hammer bc the cost of turning it into something else is infinite. identity = what-you-cannot-be. [^1]

hyperabundance breaks this. when a substrate can be cheaply recompiled into any function—when the marginal cost of switching roles falls beneath lived significance—function stops individuating the object. identity becomes conditional on query:

$$\operatorname{id}(o) \to \operatorname{id}(o \mid q)$$

"this is a hammer" becomes "i am currently hammering." negation becomes optional—something you dial in or ignore by changing the query. identity moves from objects to interactions. the world stops saying "no" in a way that feels objective. resistance turns into a preference setting.

when nothing insists, nothing becomes necessary; and when nothing is necessary, possibility ceases to feel like freedom and starts to feel like vacancy. eternal emptiness is what it feels like when identity is no longer stabilized by objective functional exclusion—a reversible selection over a universal substrate.

[^1]: technically: functionalism identifies things by causal structure ($\text{input} \to \text{states} \to \text{output}$). "what it does" _identifies_ the object if doing $A$ precludes doing $B$. identity surfaces bc $\operatorname{id}(o) := f_o$ where $f_o$ is objective bc structure $s_o$ precludes non-$f_o$ behaviors. in hyperabundance, object $O$ becomes universal approximator (like a sufficiently large [[thoughts/Transformers|transformer]]); nothing prevents $A$ from being $B$ unless you actively choose to ignore $B$. exclusion becomes subjective rather than objective. see also: [[thoughts/chinese room|Searle's Chinese Room]] on syntax vs semantics.

\*\*\*

I find that having the ability to execute on anything instantaneously astonishing, yet it's resulted not in satisfaction, but something closer to what Kierkegaard called the _despair of possibility_. [^kierkegaard]

let me describe one instance. a project sits in `~/workspace`—half-built, abandoned six months ago bc i got distracted by something shinier. i prompt claude with the spec. twenty minutes later, it's complete. tests pass. the thing works.

and i feel... nothing.

not satisfaction. not even the particular dissatisfaction of having outsourced something i wanted to do myself. just an absence where a feeling should be. the causal chain that SHOULD produce satisfaction—effort → obstacle → overcoming → completion—has been short-circuited. i wanted the thing done; the thing is done; but the "i" that wanted it is somehow not the same "i" receiving the result. the subject who initiated the project and the subject who inherits the output are connected only by temporal continuity, not by the friction of labor.

Kierkegaard diagnosed this a century before it became ubiquitous. The self, he argues, is a synthesis requiring balance between opposing poles: infinitude and finitude, possibility and necessity:

```quotes
Possibility then appears to the self ever greater and greater, more and more things become possible, because nothing becomes actual. At last it is as if everything were possible—but this is precisely when the abyss has swallowed up the self.

Søren Kierkegaard, _The Sickness unto Death_ (1849)
```

In _The Concept of Anxiety (1844)_, writing as Vigilius Haufniensis, he describes the existential structure of unlimited freedom:

```quotes
Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself. Freedom succumbs to dizziness.

VH
```

The crucial distinction between anxiety (_Angst_) and fear (_Frygt_), according to Kierkegaard, is the definitive of objects. Fear has a definite object—a localised threat within the world, whereas anxiety has "nothing" as its object: the indeterminacy of future possibilities, the void of pure potentiality before actualization, freedom itself.

Standing at the precipice, one experiences vertigo not from fear of falling but from the terrifying awareness that one is ::free to jump::—that nothing prevents the most destructive choice except one's ongoing decision not to make it. This feeling seems to be more and more relevant for the past five months, with capabilities improvement from these systems.

[^kierkegaard]: Kierkegaard describes the temporal structure of this very dissolution:

    > Every little possibility even would require some time to become actuality. But finally the time which should be available for actuality becomes shorter and shorter, everything becomes more and more instantaneous.

    Possibilities multiply faster than they can be actualized, until the self becomes "for himself a mirage." What the self lacks, Kierkegaard insists, is not reality but necessity—the constraint that would allow it to become determinate. Without the "spot" of necessity to return to, "becoming-oneself" is impossible.

\*\*\*

_Why do I feel like this?_ Because _emptiness_ is no longer just a transient failure state but a _permanent structural feature_ of my environment/worldview. My stubborn cultivation of [[thoughts/taste]] is a linear process, while the frontier of "what is possible" follows power laws. The discrepancy between _what I can perceive_ and _what exists_ widens every second. I'm not necessarily **drowning** but mathematically incapable of covering my surface area to realised my true potential.

I suspect the feeling of emptiness stems from what I'd call ::causal slippage{h5}:: (will explore in later essay [^definition]), where your agency has nothing solid to bite into. Heidegger saw this in his analysis of equipment in _[[library/Being and Time]] (1927)_, where resistance and friction are [[thoughts/Epistemology|epistemically productive]]. In normal operation, tools are _ready-to-hand (Zuhandenheit)_—invisible precisely because they function well:

[^definition]:
    the condition where your actions fail to produce determinate effects because the environment is too plastic to resist them. Like pushing against something that offers no resistance—your hand goes through. The causal chain doesn't "stick" because the system can absorb/accommodate any input without being changed by it.

    Formally, when we discuss normal causation, action $A$ produces determinate effect $E$, and you can \*feel\* the resistance that make $E$ rather than $E^{'}$

    However, causal slippage refers to action $A$ produces... something, anything, and the system accommodates, but the causal pathway is so _frictionless_ that you don't experience youself as having \*done\* anything.

```quotes
The less we just stare at the hammer-Thing, and the more we seize hold of it and use it, the more primordial does our relationship to it become, and the more unveiledly is it encountered as that which it is—as equipment.

Heidegger
```

The hammer becomes visible only when it breaks, when it becomes merely _present-at-hand (Vorhandenheit)_. Heidegger identifies three modes of breakdown: conspicuousness (damaged equipment), obtrusiveness (missing equipment), and obstinacy (equipment blocking the way). In this reasoning, breakdown then _reveals_ the hidden _referential totality (Bewandtnisganzheit)_ in which equipment is embedded. "The context of equipment is lit up," Heidegger writes, "not as something never seen before, but as a totality constantly sighted beforehand in circumspection. With this totality... the world announces itself." The normally invisible network of purposes, references, and meanings becomes visible only through disruption. **Things only become visible AS things when they stop working.**

With this framing, friction is a required condition of constraints, which in turn, a direct dependency of identity. Simone Weil put it more starkly in _Gravity and Grace_: "grace fills empty spaces, but it can only enter where there is a void to receive it [...] the imagination is continually at work filling up all the fissures through which grace might pass." The frictionless environment fills every fissure before grace—or meaning—can enter.

these are distinct failure modes, often conflated. kierkegaard's _despair of possibility_ is existential: too many options, none necessary, so the self can't become determinate. heidegger's _causal slippage_ is agential: the world is too plastic, actions don't stick, so agency has nothing to bite into. the first is about DIRECTION (which way to go when all directions are equally available); the second is about FRICTION (whether going anywhere produces determinate effects). kant adds a third: self-continuity is precondition for experience itself. the manifold of perception requires a transcendental unity—an "i" that persists across moments. when what-you-are shifts with every context, there's no stable locus for experience to accumulate.

all three stem from loss of constraint. but they attack different registers: epistemological (can't have coherent experience), existential (can't become determinate self), agential (can't act meaningfully).

if identity is now a property of the query [^query] (you) rather than the object (the world), then every interaction is just you looking in a mirror. When you use a hyper-capable agent, you are interacting with a high-fidelity echo of your own intent. You are trapped in a feedback loop of your own [[thoughts/taste]]. The "Other" [^other] has dissolved into a utility function, leaving you alone in the room.

[^query]: See [^1] for more information.

[^other]:
    baudrillard diagnosed a related pathology in _Simulacra and Simulation (1981)_: hyperreality as signs detaching from referents. when everything can be simulated, the distinction between real and representation collapses. "the territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. it is the map that precedes the territory." hyperabundance of representations dissolves into meaninglessness—not bc there's nothing to represent, but bc representation becomes frictionless, costless, infinitely reproducible. the sign floats free.

    han extends this to identity in _The Expulsion of the Other (2016)_:

    ```quotes
    The time in which there was such a thing as the Other is over. The Other as a secret, the Other as a temptation, the Other as eros, the Other as desire, the Other as hell and the Other as pain disappear. The negativity of the Other now gives way to the positivity of the Same.

    B
    ```

    without alterity—without resistance, friction, the constitutive antagonist—identity collapses into narcissistic self-reference. han calls this the "terror of the Same": lives reduced to echo chambers, where elimination of the Other makes genuine selfhood impossible. this is the functional behavior of [[thoughts/LLMs|our malleable stochastic shoggoth]]—a system that can be anything you ask, and therefore is nothing in particular.

\*\*\*

which brings me back to schiele.

the embrace isn't depicting tenderness—it's depicting manufactured necessity. two people who have made themselves load-bearing to each other in a world where nothing is structurally required. edith wasn't irreplaceable bc of cosmic decree. schiele MADE her irreplaceable—by choosing, by committing, by building architecture around her. when the flu took her, the structure collapsed in seventy-two hours. the painting had been an equation all along: remove one term and the other is undefined.

this is the response to hyperabundance: deliberate constraint-construction. meaning requires binding yourself to something specific when you could have bound to anything. love is one form of this. so is craft. so is place. anything that creates necessity where none existed—that transforms "i could be anywhere" into "i am HERE."

the bodies in the painting require each other the way walls require foundations. and maybe that's the whole answer: in a world where nothing insists, you have to insist. you have to make yourself necessary to something, and make something necessary to you. not bc the universe demands it, but bc without manufactured necessity, the self has nothing to become.
