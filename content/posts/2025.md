_note: I started this essay since 2025-10-04. Yet, I had a lot of trouble trying to finish this piece. This year has truly been one of the most fulfilling and saddest year of my life. It is a bit hard to capture all of these in words, but atlas here we are._

Dear [[posts/2024]] me,

2024 ended with you spending a lot of time with your family (they visited you in California) and thus there were a lot of unprompted and contingent emotions for friends and past loves came up, out of the process of writing them [[posts/24|letters]] (which is a tradition that we start in addition to writing yearly review). You found yourself among these letters, trying to unmask such emotions you once thought has gone forever. There weren't as much uncertainty as we used to have, but there were certain unresolved emotions coming up while talking with friends then. There were much to unfold, so buckle up.

I was born when she hugged me, I died when she left for the Bay, I lived those two days while she's with me.
