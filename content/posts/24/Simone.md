I'm glad that we talked more this year. Given that we are both super busy and seemingly never figured out a time to hang out together,
it has been great getting to know you a lot more.

I love that we got to see each other once in a blue moon, just to catch up.

I love that you called me whenever you need someone to talk to.

I'm sure there are many things happening your life, I know that you will eventually get it done (esp. getting a big gurl corporate job this year :happy:)

I hope you find moments of peace during the holiday season. May the new year bring you closer to your goals, but more importantly, closer to your own truth.

I believe whole-heartedly that you can do it. I know family is hard, but sometimes it is good to find a middle ground with your parents, through whatever ways possible.

Here's some reading for the break season I think you might like:

- [in a thousand year](https://substack.com/home/post/p-153398563)
- Bill Wattersonâ€™s (author of Calvin & Hobbes) [commencement speech](https://web.mit.edu/jmorzins/www/C-H-speech.html?curius=1573) at Kenyon College
- Alain de Botton's [Essays in Love](https://www.alaindebotton.com/essays-in-love/)
