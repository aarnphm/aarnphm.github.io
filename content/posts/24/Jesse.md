What an "uneventful" year it has been. Surely we haven't gone through any major development arc for any given time period at all.

All jokes aside, I'm glad that we connected and have been growing a lot closer this year. I felt like I have truly know you better as a person, and more importantly, as a friend.

I enjoyed our late night chat, endless riff on what it meant to be a "man" in this day and ages. To quote Marcus Aurelius (your favorite author):

> Let men see, let them know, a real man, who lives as he was meant to live

Hope you are enjoying your well-deserved breaks. See you folks in the new year!
