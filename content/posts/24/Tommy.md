I'm not sure what plans the universe has for either of us. All I know is we crossed paths this year, and it feels
like that happened for a reason. I don't remember the first time I tweeted at you, or how exactly you became "Tommy from Twitter," but I do remember our first walk-and-talk,
the simple clarity of it. We wandered around, seeing each other as we were, and then everything else just fell into place.

Meeting you has been the highlight of my year. You made me feel at home here in Canada, at ease. I’m grateful for that. I’m grateful because you remind me that
love—the real kind, the kind that’s full of intention—exists in the quiet, everyday moments. It’s a small miracle to keep choosing each other, over and over,
just for the sake of seeing someone as they are. To me, that’s the purest form of love, even if we can’t fully explain it.

You laugh so freely, and that reminds me that laughter is a type of grace. It’s the brief permission we give ourselves not to cling so tightly, not to overthink every little stumble. It’s a way to say,
"Yeah, life is big and strange and we’re all just figuring it out, but isn't that sort of funny?" I see you laugh at your own mistakes, at the unpredictable tangles life throws at you, and suddenly
it’s easier for me to do the same. When we laugh together, we bridge the space between us. We say, without words, that we understand each other.

I want you to know how much that means to me. In these small acts—laughing at spills, cheering from the front row, sending DMs—you've given me a sense of belonging. It's love, I think, in its most natural form. And for that, I thank you.

We don't know everything, but all we can ask each others is to do our best and try to elevate others. Everyone is your biggest fan, I'm one of them. If there are none, I'm still, _your biggest fan_.

I hope you have a well-deserved rest, and looking forward for bangers in 2025!
