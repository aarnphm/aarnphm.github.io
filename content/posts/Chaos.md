_Passage by Giorgio Morandi_

Chaos isn't merely an undercurrent of life; it's a pervasive force, ever-present, often simmering just beneath the surface, ready to erupt and manifest in myriad forms. It's not just a backdrop in the narratives of storytellers or the musings of philosophers but a distinct entity in itself, one that has the power to challenge those brave enough to embrace its unpredictability. To move abroad, to step into the unknown, is to court chaos – to acknowledge and accept the inevitability of change and the sharp tang of constant motion.

I have pretty much live by myself for more than a third of my life, (migrated to Canada when I was 16). This shift, though seemingly late when measured against the timelines of my high school friends – some of whom left home much earlier – marked a profound metamorphosis in my life. To articulate the essence of my days within the Vietnamese, or Eastern in general, public school system is a task fraught with complexity some might say. The rhythm of our lives was largely dictated by a relentless academic cycle, where rote learning was the norm, and evenings were dedicated to further educational pursuits. Yet, in this milieu of rigid conformity and strict discipline, my mom have always taught me to question relentlessly, even at the peril of punishment.

This untamed curious inner child, still clung to my being, propels me forward. Such that it is this inner chaos that encourage me to embark on this journey of understanding.


## Q: who are you trying to become?

A: Perhaps it is less about becoming but more about unravelling the complexities from within. There is a certain naive desire, a childlike curiosity, that propels me towards the unknown, the seas of uncertainty. In embracing this naive desire, I become a vessel of my own making, navigating the complex seas of existence. As it may be, at the moment, I'm trying to protect that child and shield him from the turbulence and chaos we call life.

## Q: why can't you move back home?

Consider the river and the dam. The river, a living artery, courses from its source with a purpose as clear as its waters. It meanders, shaped by the land it traverses, until it reaches the dam. Here, it lies in a deep réservoir, a body of water in waiting, destined to flow through turbines and continue its journey downstream. This cycle is perpetual: the sun draws the water skyward, and it returns as rain, nourishing the earth on its way back to the river. But the droplets that return are transformed, no longer the same entities that once rested in the dam’s embrace.

The act of leaving one’s home for foreign shores is akin to such journey - a voyage of transformation, of encountering new landscapes, of merging with unfamiliar currents. When one leaves home, they embark on a trajectory vastly different from those who stay. The familiar becomes distant, and upon return, the once-known world feels alienated. You stand apart, changed in the eyes of those who remember you once were. "Home" remains a static concept, a memory preserved in amber, while you, like the river, have been irrevocably altered by your experiences. _In other words, this is often known as [[thoughts/displacement|the theme of displacement]]_

To return home is to face a poignant paradox: the physical space may be unchanged, the same faces may greet you, the house of your childhood may still nestle in its familiar spot, but your perception of it all has shifted. Gone the person you once was; now you have become the confluence of experiences that mold the "now" you, just as the returning water is forever changed by its journey.

Yet, despite these changes, the essence remains. The being of 'aqua', remains unchanged, as the inner child within us persists. It is this unchanging essence that bridges the gap between the person we have become and the place we once called home. The question, then, is not why you cannot move back home, but rather, how can one reconcile the transformed self with a place that is both intimately familiar and strangely foreign, a place etched in memory, unchanged by time yet estranged by the journey’s passage.

I like this little corner I'm having in this period of life. It start to grow on me. It is nothing grandiose, or anything glamorous. Hamilton as a town?
It is a steel town. But this one street Locke street, pretty cool.

Settling down, for a person that somewhat travels around for the last seven years of their life.

Changes are hard, and people afraid they will fail when they got out of their comfort zone. It presupposes the boundaries that one deemed as safety, as it requires one to outgrow one’s bounds. The decision of moving into a different domains signals every challenge there are, but it is exciting to explore. I do think one thing that prevents one from chances is also monetary policy. Nowadays there isn't enough capital motives to invoke one to induce self-change.

But chaos despises safety. Safety creates entrapment, which one would fail to grow.

Life

Rhetorical question is why do I have to be so afraid of the world and how do I know that I am not alone? Yet I always know there will always be more people that loved me than I ever know. I want to believe that they would miss me if I disappear from the realm of existence
The world is a scary place, but I’m living through it. The overman should be looking after me, that overman is a facade we all put on

Just got off a call with a friend from hs, which is a rare occurrence. I think
