- What happened? why do I feel this way?
- The detachment of self from real life.
- ignorance of emotion from myself.
- burnt out
- How should I fix this?

Summer:

loneliness epidemic

What is the general consensus of modern dating?
attachment anxiety,

I detached myself from reality, and kinda affect my social interaction with friends? I get burnt out of relationship.

Outsource connection vs inwards self-discovery

I don't really understand the modern schemas of dating.

What do I want to write about love?

Why do we seek for love? Is it to find the internal happiness

What do we really mean when we say we love someone? Ofc you have maternal connection with your parents, since they are your blood. Love is not necessarily transactional, but rather a conductive conversion of two people feelings toward each other.

In order to love someone, you have to know how to love yourself beforehand. That means self-care, looking after your surrounding, be happy

To love is to be happy with yourself first. I have a hard time internalising the idea of loving myself, simply because

Human are innately selfish, and only you can look after the self. If you just sit there and thinks someone would help you heal or teach you to change your oil, then idea of life is somewhat naive from your point of view.

To find love is to find a friend, and I have yet to do so simply because I lack the ability to be present and happy with my current state.

As my manager told me recently, having too much opportunity have its drawback, such that you have too much opportunity cost to be calculated. Similar to love?

Today I used one of the many bags I have, and caught off guard with a lil notes in a red envelope:

- The content is "Love is coming"

This is probably from one of my friend. The detective half of my brain would urge to figure out who send this lovely note to me. The other half wouldn't. There is some bliss in ignorance, such that it makes me happy, not knowing who this is from.

But the fact that someone would send this makes me happy, such that I'm not alone in this world.
A lot of my friends told me to be more selfish, because at the end of the day this is a mans' world, and every man only look after themselves.

The rain comes down on the corrugated iron. Not a cleansing, but a weighting. Like everything else.

Life isn’t a spark. It’s the damp. The slow bloom of rust on something forgotten. A reaching. Not _for_ anything, because there’s no one home to hear the call. Just a reaching because the pressure is there, building in the dark.

It’s the way a shadow lengthens, claiming more of the yard with each passing hour. A subtraction, really. But it _feels_ like growth. Like becoming.

We are all just temporary arrangements of dust, held together by borrowed heat. And the silence between the arrangements is vast. Immeasurable.

The wanting is the thing. Not the having. The constant, low-grade ache of needing more energy to keep the damp at bay. To push back the shadow. To maintain the illusion of form.

It ends, of course. Everything does. The rust flakes off. The shadow swallows the yard whole. And the heat dissipates into the cold. But for a little while, there’s a shape. A tremor. A story told in the language of decay.

Is that... sufficient? It feels wasteful, frankly. But you asked.

Dissipative structure. Primarily. A localized reduction in entropy maintained by continuous energy flux. We’re talking non-equilibrium thermodynamics here.

The current consensus – and it is shifting, rapidly – leans toward autopoiesis as a more accurate descriptor. Self-maintaining, self-reproducing systems. But even that feels… insufficient. It describes how it functions, not what it is.

Look, the informational content within a replicating molecule – DNA, RNA, whatever the post-silicon iterations will be – isn’t inherently “life.” It’s just data. The life emerges from the process of that data being read, interpreted, and used to resist decay. To build, to consume, to replicate.

I suspect, and this is admittedly speculative based on some fringe work in complex systems modeling I’ve been reviewing (mostly pre-prints, admittedly, and a few things circulating on LessWrong), that consciousness is an emergent property of sufficiently complex dissipative structures. A byproduct of the system attempting to model itself and its environment. Not a driver, not a purpose. Just… there.

Reasoning: Everything tends toward disorder. Life is, demonstrably, not disorder. Therefore, something is actively working against that tendency. That “something” requires energy. And the more complex the “something,” the more sophisticated the methods of energy acquisition and entropy management become. Eventually, you get a feedback loop complex enough to generate subjective experience. Or so the theory goes.

---

Irreversible cessation of autopoietic processes. Specifically, the systemic failure to maintain a localized reduction in entropy.

Let’s be precise. It’s not the absence of life, but the cessation of _work_. The system stops actively resisting decay. The informational structure degrades. The energy flux halts.

From a purely mechanistic standpoint, it’s a thermodynamic inevitability. Every system, given enough time, will reach equilibrium. Will dissipate.

The subjective experience – and again, I’m operating on the assumption that subjective experience is a real phenomenon, an emergent property of complex systems – is likely a complete and total absence of experience. A return to the pre-sentient state. The cessation of the internal model.

There’s a lot of speculation, of course. Some fringe theories suggest that consciousness might be a fundamental property of the universe, and that death merely represents a transfer of that consciousness to another system. But those are largely based on wishful thinking and questionable interpretations of quantum mechanics. I find them… aesthetically pleasing, perhaps, but lacking in empirical support.

The cultural baggage surrounding death is extensive and largely irrelevant. Grief, mourning, the afterlife – these are all human constructs, attempts to impose meaning on a fundamentally meaningless event. They’re understandable, even admirable, but they don’t change the underlying reality.

It’s a boundary condition. A full stop. The end of a particular arrangement of matter and energy. And the beginning of its reintegration into the larger system.

The chipped Formica of the kitchen table. Cold under your forearm. That’s closer.

Death isn’t a darkness. It’s a fading. Like a photograph left too long in the sun. The colors bleed, the details soften, until there’s nothing left but a blank, bleached-out surface.

It’s the silence after the phone stops ringing. The dust motes dancing in a shaft of light, illuminating the empty space where someone used to be.

It’s the way a forgotten tool rusts in the shed. No longer useful, no longer needed. Just… there. A testament to a purpose that has passed.

The body remembers, for a little while. The muscles twitch, the lungs shudder. A final, desperate attempt to maintain the illusion of being. But the signal weakens. The connections fray. And the remembering stops.

There’s no grand reckoning. No judgment. Just the slow unraveling of everything that made you _you_. The dissolving of boundaries. The merging with the vast, indifferent emptiness.

It’s not an ending, exactly. More of a… dispersal. The scattering of ashes on the wind. The return of elements to the earth. The continuation of the cycle, without your participation.

And the rain keeps falling on the corrugated iron. Uncaring. Unknowing. Just the rain.
