Beneath the quiet of night,
  under  the  vast  sky,
  where stars whisper stories of ancient light,
  I find you again in the sigh of the wind,
  in the gentle caress of the moon's soft beam.

Your smile, a memory etched in the stars,
  a lantern guides me through the harrowed wall,
    of my heart.
  A rose in dawn's light, so bright,
    a memory of you, carved into my mind.

The miles stretched wide,
  a chasm of silent cries,
  a beacon I thought would endure the test of time.
    But time, a cruel mistress,
      adds distance to the miles,
      a facade of perfection, at best, a jest.

I find you in the quiet of the night,
