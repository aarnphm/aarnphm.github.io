![[posts/images/love-in-life.webp|Nothing personal, James Baldwin]]

friendship is about giving enough [[thoughts/Attention|attention]]

on vulnerability and opening up your feelings, to then truly shut it all down regretting being vulnerable in the first place

I picked up John Green's _An Abundance of Katherines_

I think I'm going insane, my heart aches. It felt heavy

on catching feelings for a friend, rather a longing to be loved, to fill the void J once left
