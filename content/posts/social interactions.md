depends on previous context when you name drop them

How I felt like larger groups are often more draining, in a sense we act accordance with an implicit theory of mind in each person we surround ourselves with.

I don't really understand why it felt so weird "mentioning" people on either twitter timeline, or any other platform.
The notion of mentioning always seems like introducing additional noise into the other person life. Maybe it is because life is already have enough entropy, then tagging people
felt like introducing more trouble into their life.

I'm not saying tagging is bad, given that mentioning in workplace makes sense. I think there are just something confrontational about doing so to strangers you don't know.

I do like the notion of tagging, gives a sense of personalisation. A person that mentions you must have formulate ideas surrounding topics that involves you, in the process trying to work
towards either a net positive work.

Maybe the general consensus of tagging is that sometimes we associated it with the notion of something bad happens. (notably about cancel culture)

I like a [[thoughts/friendship]] where I can be unapologetically myself, and I see myself in this with Nicky. We don't judge each others, even though
sometimes we observe each others' life from afar. I enjoy having these relationship in a sense that whenever we see each other, it felt like time have never left the station.
