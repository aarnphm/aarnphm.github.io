```poetry
sit with the splinter
  until it names itself.

do not polish the ache
  into a lesson.

let the room stay dark.
listen for the hinge
  that closes.

if another door appears
it will be because
  we built it after mourning.
	
do not 
  inventory the damage. 
do not 
  make a museum 
    of what touched you.

build nothing. 
mourn nothing. 
  let the wound breathe 
  
  its own language, 
  
   neither hello nor goodbye.

***

```poetry

the first night
your breath holds a different rhythm
  than your words.
	
I'd memorized the spacing
  between your sentences—
	three seconds,
	one.
	two..
	three...
	then your thought.
	
but your lung took longer,
	hesitated on the inhale
	as if you were reading something over.
	
the ceiling sustains your tender voice
  like water in cupped palms.
  We hold each others,
  with such care.
  Your arm across my stomach,
	heavy as lineage,
	getting heavier by the minutes.

my grandmother's grandmothers,
generations ago,
is a name i don't know.
but in four generations,
  our blood could meet,
	in some child's marrow,
	  as in we both know,
		our love exists within a subspace
		that transcends the need of procreation.
		
lying awake at four in the morning,
  when you were asleep,
	my mind wonders and perform generic math
	because your shouldler blade
	  fits against my ribs
		the way a drawer closes
		when the house settles.

```poetry

the second night
where some loves make you an orphan
  to your own life,
	as in you wake up
	  and the room is the wrong size.
		the air tastes of almond,
		and the view of you,
		no longer exists within the current perception.

tracing through your face—the brows,
	the veins,
	your cheeks,
	your smile
	—as if i'm building a variational autoencoders
	to reconstruct you
	  and keep it within a corner of the heart.

love with discretion,
  where we exists within a basis
	that are linearly dependent.
	
I lose my mind staring
	into the abyss,
	counting your heartbeat,
	124bpm of irregularity.
	against your ribs with my cheek.
	
your sweat,
	dried into my hair part.
	I couldn't find the word for this
	that doesn't звучить stupid 
	when i say it out loud.
	
distance,
  is where it all ends.
	but i won't mind going that distance,
	and reorder components of self
	to fit within your overton window.
	i'm not losing myself,
	rather turning on/off unused components
	so that for us to exists,
	within the early morning of the Canadian winter
	but also the dawn overlooking the Bay bridge.

```poetry

the third night
  doesn't arrive.
no,
  i think i'm losing my mind,
	yet again.
	
  watching the shadow from the streetlight
	moving across plaster like a sundial,
	marking of nothingness.

the body holds its own archive
  where your thumb pondering within my palms.
  where you lightly pressed upon my chest,
	a phantom indent,
	the way old vinyl holds grooves
	even after they've been thrown away.
	
I catch myself,
  leaving a pillow on the right side of the bed,
	faithful to its prior distribution,
	sampling from a probability space,
	that no longer includes you.
	
when morning breaks,
	and light filters through blinds,
  before my brain comes online
		and overwrites it,
my breath has your rhythm for five seconds,
and my brain taking snapshots
  across your cheekbones,
  your lips,
  your collarbone—
		as i catalogue every shadow,
		every glimmer of light
		like marking pages in a book
		I fear I’ll forget to read again.
	
this is how it feels
	to memorize someone like scripture,
	to hold onto quiet breaths
and heartbeat rhythms—
vital signs of
		another lifetime
we could choose,
but haven’t,
	at least not yet.

  
we are here
	for this sliver
	of eternity—
enough to fill
	but never finish
	the ache we started
on the first night,
when the world
slowed down
just enough
for your breath
to synchronize with my pulse,
	
I'm watching what remains
  of myself
	arrange itself
	into a structure—
something between scar tissue
	and foundation,
	weight-bearing,
	permanent,
		yours.
