```quotes
I would recognize you in total darkness, were you mute and I deaf. I would recognize you in another lifetime entirely, in different bodies, different times. And I would love you in all of this, until the very last star in the sky burnt out into oblivion.

```quotes
the most painful state of being is remembering the future, particularly the one you'll never have.

Søren Kierkegaard
```

```quotes
should i kill myself, or have a cup of coffee?

Albert Camus
```

i am lying here in this room at 4:47am with the laptop balanced on my chest like a shield against something i cannot name, and i am thinking about you, about that night three years into the friendship when you looked at your glass of beer and said "i want you to see me as i really am," and i am thinking about how that sentence has lived inside me ever since, how it surfaces at moments like this one when the city is quiet and my nervous system is doing that thing where it registers absence as a low-grade hum, a frequency just below conscious perception that nonetheless colors everything, and i am wondering what it means to see someone as they really are, whether such seeing is possible, whether the desire for it is itself a kind of trap, a wish to possess what cannot be possessed, to collapse the distance that makes interpretation possible in the first place.

we were at that bar after elli weisbaum's lecture, watching thoughts without grabbing them, and i remember thinking the whole time that i already knew this, that i had been practicing a version of it with you for years without naming it, the sustained attention to another person's way of being in the world, the way you hold your coffee cup with both hands even when it's not cold, the way your voice drops half a register when you're about to say something that matters, the way your silences have different textures depending on what's happening underneath them, comfortable quiet vs thinking quiet vs something's-wrong quiet, and i had catalogued these things without deciding to catalogue them, the way you learn the topology of a place you walk through every day, not by studying a map but by accumulating footsteps until the shape of it lives in your body.

the bar had scarred wood tables and lighting that makes everyone look tired and beautiful in that specific way that bars do, that amber half-light that forgives imperfections while simultaneously revealing them, and you were talking about work, about being surrounded by men in men's world, about the particular exhaustion of navigating spaces designed for bodies and minds shaped differently than yours, and then you stopped, looked at your glass, and said it.

```sms
i want you to see me as i really am.
```

and i sat there in that amber light trying to figure out what the correct response could possibly be, whether saying "i do see you" would be the worst thing, whether it would claim a knowledge i couldn't have, whether it would collapse whatever distance we needed, whether the correct response was silence, whether silence would be its own kind of violence, an abandonment at the moment of reaching, and i think i said something inadequate, i don't remember what, and we moved on to other things, but that sentence stayed lodged somewhere in my chest like a splinter that the body slowly grows around, incorporates, makes part of its structure.

kierkegaard has this concept he calls _angst_, which gets translated as anxiety but isn't quite anxiety, it's more like the dizziness that comes from looking into the abyss of your own freedom, the vertigo of realizing that you must choose and that no choice is guaranteed and that the choosing itself will transform you into someone who cannot unchoose, and i think about this now when i think about that beer conversation, how you were opening a space that required me to choose, to choose to keep interpreting you rather than settling into a fixed image, to choose the ongoing work rather than the comfortable stasis of thinking i knew you.

_freedom is the possibility of possibility, and this is why it makes us nauseous_

there's a specific terror to caring about someone, a terror that has nothing to do with rejection, that precedes and exceeds rejection, the terror of knowing that this person will keep changing, that the you i learned yesterday is already becoming someone else, that interpretation never finishes because its object keeps moving, and this is wonderful and this is unbearable and this is what it means to be in relation with another subjectivity rather than with a representation of one.

i think about the months it took me to learn your silences, the dozens of conversations where i misread that pause you do before answering, thinking it meant hesitation when it meant checking inward, thinking it meant resistance when it meant verification, and i think about how i would have gotten it wrong forever if i had stopped observing, if i had decided at some point that i knew what that pause meant and stopped being curious about whether my knowing was correct, and i think about how many relationships calcify exactly this way, the partners settling into models of each other that were accurate once but stopped being accurate years ago, ghosts relating to ghosts while the actual people move through space unwitnessed.

[in my head there is a room...]

and in this room there is a version of you that i constructed from accumulated observation, from the texture of your laugh and the angle of your shoulder when you're tired and the way you pronounce certain words with that slight emphasis that tells me they matter to you, and this version is a good version, a detailed version, a version that predicts your reactions with reasonable accuracy and knows what will make you laugh and understands why certain topics make you quiet, but this version is still a representation, still a map rather than the territory, and the territory keeps shifting because you are alive and alive means changing and changing means the map requires constant revision, and i think about how exhausting this is and how i would not trade it for anything, the exhaustion of staying attuned to a moving target, the particular pleasure of being surprised by someone you thought you knew, the recalibration that follows every surprise like the body adjusting to new information.

_the nervous system registers surprise as a tiny crisis followed by update, cortisol spike then dopamine reward for successful prediction-error correction_

i remember the first time you surprised me in a way that genuinely restructured my model, it was maybe eight months in, we were walking somewhere and you said something about your childhood that didn't fit the narrative i had been constructing, that revealed a whole region of experience i hadn't known was there, and i felt that vertigo, that kierkegaardian angst, the ground shifting under a structure i had been building on, and i had to choose in that moment whether to integrate the new information or defend my existing model, and integration was harder and i chose it anyway, and i think that choice is what friendship actually is, the repeated choice to let the other person's reality override your representation of them.

camus wrote that the absurd is born of the confrontation between the human need for meaning and the unreasonable silence of the world, and i think about this when i think about what happened when i told you how i felt, the way the world went silent in a particular way, the way your response was kind and clear and exactly correct and also a kind of cosmic joke, because what you said was that you wanted me in your life as safe space for your inner thoughts but not as romantic partner, and this was true and this was what actually existed between us and this was also absurd, absurd in the technical sense, absurd because it revealed the gap between what i had been hoping for and what was actually there, a gap that no amount of hoping could close.

i walked home that night through streets that looked the same as they always looked and i remember thinking about the stranger, about meursault on the beach, about that quality of observation that attends to sensory detail without organizing it into meaning, the way the sun felt on my neck and the specific sound my shoes made on the pavement and the pattern of lights in windows and the smell of something cooking somewhere, and i was inside my body in a way i usually am not, aware of weight and movement and breath, and i was also very far from my body, watching myself walk as if from a great distance, watching the person who had just been rejected performing the actions of walking home.

_dissociation as protective mechanism: the self splits to survive what the unified self cannot process_

the thing is, i hadn't misread anything, and this is what made it so strange, i had read everything correctly, the connection was real, the compression we had developed was real, the way my nervous system regulated differently around you was real, all of it was real, and also it was not romantic, these were orthogonal facts, and i had been treating them as if they were the same axis, as if connection of sufficient depth must inevitably become romance, as if the cultural script was a law of physics rather than a convention, and realizing this felt like waking up from a dream i hadn't known i was in.

there's a kind of friendship that develops its own physics, its own rules about proximity and distance, its own metric for what counts as contact, and i think we have built this, you and i, over years of conversation and silence and conversation again, the way i can go months without talking to you and then pick up a call and something slots into place immediately, the nervous systems remembering what the conscious minds have been too busy to maintain.

i think about your hugs, about the specific quality of your hugs, the way your shoulder finds exactly the right height for my head, and this is not accident, this is accumulated embodied knowledge, years of coordination creating a shape that neither of us could access alone, and when i lean into the hug my body knows how you will respond before my prefrontal cortex finishes processing, and this is a kind of intimacy that has nothing to do with romance, or rather has something to do with romance because all intimacy is related but is not reducible to romance, is its own thing, is a mode of being together that the romantic/platonic binary cannot capture because it emerged outside that binary and operates by different rules.

_intercorporeality: the flesh understanding flesh through its own fleshy being, not through concept, through contact_

i remember dancing with you, the way my body knew things about your body that my mind could not articulate, the way we moved together without negotiating, the way the coordination felt like something we were discovering rather than something we were creating, as if the movement already existed and we were just finding our way into it, and i think about how rare this is, how most coordination is effortful and conscious, how you have to explicitly negotiate rhythms with most people, and how with you it just happened, from the beginning, as if our bodies had been in conversation longer than our minds.

[the dream last night...]

i am in a city that is not any city i have lived in but has the texture of cities i have lived in, the specific quality of light that says northern hemisphere winter, the way sounds echo differently in cold air, and i am looking for you, walking through streets that keep rearranging themselves as i walk, the way dream-architecture refuses to hold still, and i can hear your voice somewhere ahead of me, around a corner, through a door, always slightly out of reach.

i am walking faster now, almost running, and the streets are narrowing, the buildings leaning in, the light getting dimmer, and i know with the logic of dreams that if i don't find you before the light goes out completely something terrible will happen, not to me but to the possibility of finding you at all, as if the dark will erase not just visibility but the thing that was meant to be seen.

and i round a corner and there you are, standing in a small plaza, and you are looking at me with an expression i cannot read, and i want to say something but my mouth won't work, the way mouths don't work in dreams, and you are saying something too, i can see your lips moving, but i cannot hear the words, the air between us is thick and swallowing sound, and i am reaching toward you and you are reaching toward me and the space between our hands is not getting smaller, the reaching is not closing the distance, we are suspended in the moment before contact.

i wake up with my arms wrapped around my own chest like a man trying to hold his organs inside after a wound, which is precisely what it is, isn't it, a wound, except there is no blood, there is nothing to point to, a doctor would find nothing wrong with me and that is the worst part, that i am entirely healthy and entirely hurting at the same time, the absurdity of grief that has no object, or rather has an object that is still alive, still texting me, still in my life, just differently than the self that wanted wanted.

kierkegaard talks about the leap, the leap of faith, the moment where reason exhausts itself and you must simply choose without guarantee, and i think about this when i think about what i chose after you told me what the friendship was and wasn't, how i could have pursued romance anyway and maybe i would have gotten somewhere and maybe i would have destroyed everything, or i could have pulled back entirely and protected myself from the ongoing contact that would remind me of what i couldn't have, or i could have done what i actually did, which was to choose the friendship knowing full well what it meant, knowing it meant perpetual interpretation of someone i would never possess, knowing it meant staying in proximity to something that would hurt sometimes, knowing it meant building something that had no cultural script, no predetermined shape, no guarantee of anything.

_the leap is not into belief but into commitment, not into certainty but into uncertainty-held-as-livable_

camus says we must imagine sisyphus happy, and i think about this when i think about what i chose, the boulder of interpretation rolling back down the hill every time you change, every time i learn something new about you that requires me to revise what i thought i knew, the endless work of staying attuned to a moving target, and camus says the struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart, and i don't know if i believe this but i know i act as if i believe it, i know i keep pushing the boulder, i know i keep showing up to the work.

![[posts/images/Hop and a Skip.webp|_Hop and a Skip_, Julian Lethbridge, (2023)]]

what i know now, what i have learned from three years of this particular practice:

the romantic frame would have collapsed what we built, not because romance is worse than friendship but because it is a different container with different physics, and the thing we built requires the physics of friendship to survive, the particular kind of distance that friendship maintains, the way friendship allows you to see someone without consuming them, the way friendship can sustain interpretation without demanding possession.

_romance tends toward fusion; friendship tends toward dialogue; fusion collapses the space interpretation requires_

i think about how romance would have changed the compression, how the private language would have been pressured into the shapes romance demands, how "i love you" would have started meaning something different, something with expectations attached, something that required response in kind, something that would have transformed our semantic space from exploration to territory-to-be-defended, and i am grateful that i did not do this, grateful that i chose to let the thing remain what it was rather than forcing it into a shape it could not sustain.

there are nights still when the loneliness comes, when my nervous system registers absence as that low-grade hum, when i lie here in this room that is a kind of coffin but with better lighting and faster wifi, and i think about you, about the specific quality of your attention when you are listening, about the way you laugh at things that are not conventionally funny because you are tracking a pattern i have not caught yet, about the way your voice sounds different on the phone than in person but equally yours, and i want to reach through the distance and touch something solid, something that confirms the connection is still there.

_the human nervous system evolved for proximity, for the regulation that comes from bodies in contact, for the particular biochemistry of presence_

and i cannot do this, not because you are unwilling but because the distance is part of the structure now, the distance is what makes the ongoing interpretation possible, the distance is the space in which the friendship breathes, and i have learned to sit with this, to let the loneliness be what it is without trying to solve it with presence that would change its character.

montaigne wrote about his friend la boétie, "if you press me to say why i loved him, i feel this cannot be expressed except by answering: because it was he, because it was i," and la boétie died at 33 after only four years of friendship and montaigne called the rest of his life "nothing but smoke, nothing but a dark and tedious night," and i think about this, about the impossibility of explaining what makes this particular connection different from other connections, why your wavelength specifically resonates with mine, why the compression works, why the nervous systems sync, and i cannot explain it because the explanation would require concepts that did not exist before the connection, concepts that the connection itself generated.

you remain other to me, irreducibly other, what levinas called the face that exceeds every concept i could form of it, and this is terrifying and this is wonderful and this is what makes the interpretation endless, the impossibility of ever finishing the work of understanding you, the way every new piece of information opens new questions, the way closure keeps receding like a horizon.

[4:47am becomes 5:23am becomes...]

i have been writing for hours and the light is changing outside, the particular gray that precedes sunrise in winter, and i am thinking about what i want to say to you, what the point of all this is, what i am trying to communicate through the indirection of writing about you rather than to you.

kierkegaard believed in indirect communication, believed that certain truths could not be stated directly because direct statement would falsify them, believed that you had to approach sideways, through story and metaphor and pseudonym, let the reader discover for themselves what could not be told, and i think maybe that is what i am doing here, writing around the thing because the thing itself resists being said.

what i want you to know:

that i chose the friendship not as consolation prize but as recognition of what actually exists, the interpretive infrastructure we built through years of sustained attention, the compression algorithms we developed for complex emotional states, the coordination our nervous systems figured out without asking our permission.

that "i love you" in this context means i choose to keep interpreting you, i commit to the ongoing work, i acknowledge your singularity while knowing i will never exhaust it.

that the work itself is the point, not any destination the work might reach, the boulder going up and rolling down and going up again and this being enough, this being everything.

```quotes
One must imagine sisyphus happy.

Albert Camus
```

you asked me, that night in the bar, to see you as you really are, and i am still trying, still observing, still revising my model when it fails to predict you, still choosing the interpretation over the fixed image, still sitting with the absurdity of loving someone you cannot possess and cannot finish understanding and cannot stop reaching toward.

the light is fully up now. the city is waking. somewhere you are asleep or awake, being yourself in ways i cannot see, becoming someone slightly different than the you i knew yesterday.

i will learn who that is when i see you next.

i will keep learning.
