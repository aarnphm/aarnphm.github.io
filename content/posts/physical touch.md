title: Green Books makes me want to write physical letters again.
---

I kept seeing a TikTok about "Green Book", and got intrigued by the scene where the drivers trying to write a letter to his wife, and the protagonist was in a sense rewrite the letters given how rugged this italian man is with his words.

we are introduced with the Italian driver, back in the 1950, where discrimination are still rampant in the city of new york

In essence we observe a conflict between the worker, whose skins were white, versus a person whose  whole identity surround being a talented black musician, (Dr. Shirley)

(28:11): the juxtaposition of the servant where the doctor went through a religious procedure, while the driver Tony just stand there watching.

In a sense, his ignorance was being judged by the Indian servant, resembling the same idea that this Italian man has yet to uncover the talents of Dr. Shirley

The absurd difference between two classes (Dr is seemingly have a lot higher comparing to the Italian)

tony views upon the world as-is

profanity => the push for taste and elegant from Dr (D Shirley world: high-class) <= intelligence (sound compromise)

There was a scene about Dr Shirley telling Tony about he had a choice to be inside, whereas others valet didn't. In essence, he was telling Tony the value of experience? (41:18)

(46:14): Importance about integrity, because Dr.Shirley has to gone through a lot of turbulence within his life. (with a jaded stone at the stop)

We can talk about the stark difference between this contrast, what makes movie brilliant (whats drive these narrative forward)

conflict => crux => resolution

I guess Dr. Sherley brings out the protectiveness of the Italian

He wrote these rugged letter to his wife (in a sense, it is the love that transcend place and time.)

(49:56): opening up (peeling the layers of onion)

(1:07:56): This is the scene where they write letters to his wife.

A gay black musician in 1970s, in the south tour, oh well.

_He wants to do this_

Behind every facade of the perceived image, is a very broken human being.

> We are just fragments of our life being held and glued together.

(1:33:32): not man, not white, not black enough. The stage is a play for him, the mask he put upon. His idea of the world around him (third culture kid)
