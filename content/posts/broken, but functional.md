Tuesday, Feb 13rd,  23:00, I was working on that one assignment and preparing for a system control labs the next morning, when I saw a discord notification popped up:

> "Emergency meeting, now"

My body then mindlessly navigate through that one discord chat with my friends, knowing there has been developments with the current love story. This has been going on for a while, and it seems to occupied J's mind. It was a weird one, one that I yet to have experience. You know, one of those "girl's problem" where they seemed to enjoyed each other company, yet there were attachment issues involved. They are good friends, and they appreciate each others company, feels like they are something more, yet they refrain on moving forward, or putting a "label" to whatever between them.

Reminiscing the past, I was in a similar situation, albeit less dramatics and less fa-zass. The feeling that you felt so strong for this one person is undeniable. The type of feeling that one only experience through those coffee dates, library study-together. It seems like you know so much about this person, yet you barely know about them. It all seems like you are way over your head with this person. Then, that person just simply slip away. Is it because of the way I talked, or how I portray myself? I since then learned people did these inexplicable things largely in favor of their own needs and wants, based on their own paranoias, personal attachment, personal drive. And it is ok, people come and go, no need to invest too much thoughts towards.

The idea of platonic [[thoughts/relationships|relationships]] seems

It seems like the general consensus of dating has changed, or at least morphed into the socio-dynamics of modern day society.?

It seems like people are more afraid of commitment, or they are more afraid of being hurt. Who wouldn't? Given all of the horrible things that are happening in the world, one way or another it manifests into our own interactions, think  It seems like people are more afraid of being vulnerable, or they are more afraid of being judged. It seems like people are more afraid of being alone, or they are more afraid of being with someone.

I don't really understand the mordern schemas of dating.
