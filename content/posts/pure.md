One thing I realised that I'm pretty much a workaholic, although I do have the constant feeling of not able to do enough. Work, though satisfying, does keep me awake at night. Mainly because the degree of care I put into honing my craft that exhibits sort of a tensions where I must keep going to

friendship is about giving enough [[thoughts/Attention|attention]]

I preemptedly book a staycation during reading week, because why not do things more spontaneously if you can afford to do so?

if you're asleep, i hope this finds you drifting softly among the stars, dreaming of the life you want to live, feeling that quiet pull of what you long to do. i hope you find solace in the small things—how you know yourself best—and protect your calmness, gently, against whatever currents try to pull you under.

and if you're awake, half-caught between wanting and waiting, i hope you're kind to the way your mind spirals back to the same person, the same moment, the same what-if that sits in your chest like a stone you've learned to carry. there's something about yearning that makes you feel ridiculous and profound at once—like you're simultaneously the most cliché version of yourself and also touching something ancient, something everyone who has ever loved has felt, which is maybe why every generation writes the same songs about longing and thinks they've discovered it for the first time. you'll be making coffee and suddenly you're thinking about how they laugh—not the laugh itself but the specific way their shoulders move, the half-second before the sound arrives—or you're on the train and a stranger's cologne reminds you of them and your whole body remembers before your brain catches up, which is its own kind of knowledge, the somatic archive we carry of people we've lost or never fully had. it's exhausting, this double life you lead, where half of you is here doing the dishes and responding to emails and half is somewhere else entirely, with someone who may not even know the weight of the space they occupy in you, may not even remember that tuesday in september when they said something that changed the entire architecture of how you see yourself.

i think yearning persists because it's a kind of faith, and also because it's a technology for manufacturing meaning in a world that doesn't automatically provide it. not religious faith, but the faith that what you feel matters, that it's pointing you somewhere real, that the intensity of your wanting corresponds to some deeper truth about what's possible between two people. most of the time we're told to be practical, to guard ourselves, to not invest too much too soon, to keep our options open like we're comparison shopping for a mattress, which is to say we're encouraged to treat love as an optimization problem when really it's more like a wound that won't close or a song you can't stop humming. but yearning doesn't care about any of that, doesn't respect the advice your therapist gives you about boundaries or the think-pieces about attachment styles. it makes you foolish in ways that feel almost devotional. it makes you write texts you don't send, study them for tone and subtext, delete them, rewrite them, finally send something bland that reveals nothing. makes you take the long way home past their street hoping for the coincidence that never comes, makes you replay conversations looking for hidden meanings that probably aren't there but might be, and isn't that possibility itself worth something? and maybe half of yearning is just about having something to yearn for—something that proves you're still capable of wanting past the point of reason, still believe in the possibility of being transformed by another person, still haven't cynical-ed yourself into the corner where nothing feels worth the risk, which is really a kind of death, to stop wanting things badly enough to make yourself vulnerable.

the twilight hours make it worse, or better—i can't decide. that blue-grey moment when you're not sure if it's ending or beginning, when the world is soft and uncertain and you feel like you could be anyone, become anyone, when the membrane between who you are and who you want to be feels permeable enough to slip through. there's a specific quality to the light then, neither day nor night, that seems to give permission to feel things you've been suppressing, to want things you've been pretending not to want, to imagine futures that seem impossible in the harsh light of noon. then noon light comes harsh and clarifying and you remember you have a dentist appointment, that your mother called three days ago, that you promised your friend you'd read their draft by friday, that you're supposed to be working on that presentation, that there are groceries to buy and bills to pay and the whole machinery of a life that continues regardless of how you feel. real life with its demands and routines, its insistence that you be a person who functions, who shows up, who doesn't spend entire afternoons staring out windows thinking about someone's hands. but even then, even in the bright middle of the day when you're supposed to be fully yourself and fully here, there's that part of you that's still drifting, still caught in the undertow of wanting something—someone—you can't quite have or name or explain to anyone who asks why you look so distracted lately, why you're different now in ways you can't articulate, why you keep checking your phone like you're waiting for a message that may never arrive, and the waiting itself has become a kind of home.
