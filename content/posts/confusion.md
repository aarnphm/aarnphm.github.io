I don't know where to begin. It is an emotion that I can't seem to describe. The act of putting up a pragmatic filter.

I'm stuck, I don't know how to proceed with her.

- I'm raw, as it gets
- I thought I don't have to put up an act
  - I guess I'm wrong

"On Friendship" by Montaigne, he wrote:

What I did wrong?

- Seemingly bring down the barrier I thought it was safe to brought down
- Misunderstood the boundaries that we have as a friends
- The enthusiasm of sharing seemingly to be misplaced, and mistaken with romantic gestures
  - coupled with the fact that one expressed previous romantic feelings
  - But I thought that once you told me to stop, I stop.
  - Naive heart longing for connection
    - Montaigne wrote this in P.10-11: "One has to tread this friendship with care and caution"
    - I felt like I'm about to lose her, forever
  - It felt brittle, as if just one more mistakes, then its gone.
    - Baseball simile

What do I do when she doesn't want me?

What is this feeling of being in love, yet so confused about things going slow?

What did I do wrong mostly? It felt like I didn't even know how to behave correctly? I can't just seemingly to love one to the full extend
