Hamilton, May 30th

The pavement breaths heat like a living dragon,
  channeling its inner wrath upon the world.
  That particular May shimmer rises,
  bleeds a certain light into brick, chalking the laughter against the wall.
  A pin up smiles beside it, knee braced for flight,
  forever mid‑leap yet never leaving.

Strange how leaves fall in May heat,
confused maples letting go
what they meant to keep.
The sun light dooms over the tinted sunroof
  lightly fainted within its own shadow, unable to escape
  from its predescribed positions.

Outside, maples empty their pockets;
  leaves pirouette down the alley, scratch
like stylus on weather’s soft vinyl.
Through the mullioned window their rust
  tumbles in slow‑motion cinema, each spin
  a subtitle for change we haven’t yet learned to read.

The bar top is carrara moonstone,
veined like a river under late‑October ice.
One votive drips a gold heartbeat into the glass,
its flame rehearsing small revolutions of warmth.

You stand across from me, that smile
arriving first, as always. Between us:
two espresso martini, the quiet fact
of your empty Monday mornings now.

Like this city’s noon—a kiln of gold
that bakes the pavement, thick and old—
so the world can scorch, a job dissolved
to ash, where certainties devolved.

They wanted you smaller. Spreadsheet-sized.
As if anyone could budget light,
parse out joy in quarterly reports.
Some things refuse the framework.

But you, dear, are no Applicant’s pawn:
no hollow suit to be tried on,
no doll sewn shut for want or need,
no rubber heart for mouths to feed.

I saw you first where glasses chimed—
a laugh like rain through August’s grime.
Your smile: a daisy in the blaze,
refusing drought, its roots ablaze.

They said bring your hand, show it’s filled!
But yours was open, earthward spilled—
not empty, no—a fallen leaf
that trusts decay breeds no true grief.

Let contracts burn like cinders, rise!
You wear no armor, no disguise.
Naked as paper? Good. Let’s trace
the map your courage etches in that space.

See how the maple sheds its crown?
Red-gold surrender, drifting down
to nurse the soil. That’s how you fall:
not failure, but a sacred call
to root again. Your fire’s not sold.

I've been thinking about trees—how they know
to let go precisely when holding on
becomes the heavier burden. Not failure.
Just seasons doing what seasons do.

Tomorrow, someone will ask what you're missing.
A title. A desk. That particular weight
of belonging somewhere Monday through Friday.

But I've watched you fill rooms
  with something unquantifiable. Call it
presence. Call it the thing that makes
  strangers turn, lean in, remember
they came here to feel alive;
  to feel
      seen.

The leaves outside drift past the window.
Even in this wrong season, they fall
with such specific grace.
  Passes through the busy walks of this combobulated life.
    just passing through.

So let May’s fever fret and cling.
You’re spring’s own verb, releafing.
Friend, you are the light you bring.

When closing time fractures the candle,
we shoulder jackets leaf‑brown, step outside.
The streetlight combs orange through the debris,
and every fluttering scrap of foliage
  feels like a frantic letter addressed to tomorrow—
    unsigned, but we pocket it just the same.
```
