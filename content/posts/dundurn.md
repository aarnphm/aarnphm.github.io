_[The fluorescent tube hummed, buzzed as if it, too, owed back rent.]_

The apartment was a cast-off corner of an old paper-mill floor, ten paces to the windows still filmed with wood dust.
Sunlight crept a cautious half-flight up the ashen brick, then gave up, leaving the upper reaches in permanent dusk. Steel trusses crossed fifteen—no, twenty—feet overhead, bolted tight as though to contain the resonance of its past glory days.

The weight of that cieling lodged between the shoulder blades; you walked in already stooped. Air tasted of dry pulp and latent cold.

A galley kitchenette clung to the south wall: single hot‑plate, half‑sized fridge, enamel sink no wider than the protagonist's shoulders. Opposite squatted a futon beneath drifts of half‑folded laundry. Between them, a blond‑wood desk sagged under twin monitors an aging MacBook whose keys glowed only on the right; the A and W had been thumbed to ghosts. Eight espresso cups ringed the trackpad like votive candles. The cast-iron radiator—rust-scarred, bulldog-bellied—knocked Morse into the planks.

_one, two, three,...six, six, seven, eight, ..., ten, ... ,seventeen. They counted between the flickers._

Page sixty-three again. _Vereinbarung._ The cursor hadn't moved for twenty minutes.

Page sixty-seven.

_Ausführungsbestimmungen_ wanted to be "executive provisions". then merely "decisions", then nothing at all. _The protagonist deleted the line and move on._

It was Tuesday, which meant he should have been on bar shift four hours ago. Or is it Thursday?

The radiator’s midnight clang unfurled through what morning light remained. He reached for the chipped Carrara-white mug; the espresso had grown a skin. His lips, split at the seam, cracked the film and tasted yesterday.

[_The tremor began in his jaw, radiated to those shaky hands. <u>Jonesing</u>[^1] for half a bar[^2]._]

Across the hall, the curtains were half-drawn again—the Dalmatians, the Caucasian in their thirties. Her blouse gaped; his hands braced the brick. Afternoon light gilded the sweat on her collarbone.

The protagonist looked away, then back.

```sms
He tongued the roof of his mouth: The chalky residue was now gone. Soon.
```

His phone buzzed. Sixteen missed calls, K at Cima's, coffee shop manager, an unfamiliar "(415)". _Delete voicemail_

[_is this who I think it is?_]

"Vereinbarung". Agreement. Arrangement. Understanding. Too many meanings. _He typed: "contract"._

Another knock. People had been knocking all week—HOA, gas inspection, vent maintenance, the property manager about the dead succulents. Or was that last week?

The Turkish cezve sat cold on the hot-plate. Was it heating? Foam seemed to rise, subside—maybe his breathing. S had brought it from the Berkeley flea market: “For our mornings.”

_Which morning? The one that stretched back in time, or forward into the one that may never come?_

Laptop showed 3:47 PM Tuesday. His watch: 8:15. The cezve was still cold. The grounds in the pot were dry, still.

The knock came again. Harder.

"It's T. From the shop."

He stood, knees buckled. _When had he last stood?_ ninty-seven pages complete. Floor tilted, then leveled. He counted the coffee bags on the counter—seventeen, half were torn, the other spilled on top of the counter--he couldn't remember emptying them.

"I know you're in there man. I can smell the coffee."

_But the cezve was cold. The protagonist smelled his palms, reeked of stale espresso._

"I'm sick", he rasped.

"Yeah, okay. Just... M wants to know if you're coming back. Ever."

The protagonist padded his pockets. Three bars--No, one. The pharmacy on King closed at six. Hand shook, steadied against the brick.

"Tell him Thursday."

"It _is_ Thursday."

Time kinked. _Ausführungsbestimmungen_ had been “executive provisions,” then “decisions,” then snow.

“NEXT THURSDAY!” he shouted, voice splintering.

Footsteps receded.

"Okay, just checking. You okay, bud?"

[The protagonist stared at the cezve. Still cold. S's mornings were five thousand miles away.]

"ye--s", he murmured.

The hallway fell silent. The protagonist saved the file "**FINAL_FINAL_V7**", and opened his notebook: "Translation as a disappearing act."
New e-mail from _ktiindustries@kti.de_: "Standard rate, due upon completion."

He dry-swallowed the last half-bar. Thought-threads arranged themselves into neat ledger rows. Outside, light drained through budding branches.

Phone rang: San Francisco again—Dr M’s office. The missed appointment.

Radiator knocked once, twice. A brown leaf pirouetted off the last living plant and lay on the sill. Tomorrow he would water them. Or Thursday. Whichever came bearing softer light.

He stood, eye fixed blankly on the door. T's footsteps had faded, but the knocking persisted inside his skull. _That clanging noise, that buzz_. His jaw tensed, and wiped the damp palms against the jeans. The tremors had returned, fingers twitching.

On the desk, pages blurred once more. He tried again to steady his breathing, his heart rattling uncertainly in his chest. Checked his watch.

[_The pharmacy closes at six_]

He fumbled for the wallet, fingers shaking as he flipped it open. Expired credit card, edges worn. He counted the bills slipping across the rugged edges -- twenty, fourty, sixty. _Barely enough for two bars._ At the entrance, he checked the cezve, still cold.

"five thousand miles,..." he murmured, tasting the words like dry parchment.

The warped floorboards yawning beneath each crooked steps. Halfway down, he leaned briefly against the cracked plaster, the wall bowing slightly, pressed against his shoulder. Outside, the streetlights blurred into watercolor halos in the twilight. Faces passed, strangers casting sidelong glances.

The pharmacy stood beside the coffee bar. Through the glass windows, he saw T leaning over the La Marzocco. Their eyes caught for a brief second, mouthing something. But the street noise--car horns, distant sirens--drowned the sound of their calling. He looked away, disappearing into the revolving door.

The pharmacist glanced up, recognition dawning in weary eyes:

"Two? Again?"

The protagonist nodded, lips parting silently.

"Give me a minute".

Shoulders tense, skin prickling beneath his shirt. Mirrors lining the back wall shines a dimple light against his fixture. A fractured procession of pale faces staring back, folding against the heavy pull of gravity. _Is this how I look now?_

Outside again, prescription folded in the palm of his hand, he hesitated. Voices grew distance, submerged beneath a rhythmic murmur, waves pulsing softly behind his temples.

[_Trinity is nearby_]

He lay back on damp grass, the pills dissolving bitter beneath his tongue. The black silk pierced by pinpoint stars, cool against burning skin. Echoes roses, softly at first--the ringtone from N [_he hasn't called her back, yet_].

Faint voices, T and K calling his name, their footstep hurried, panicked, crunching across gravel. Yet their voices faded, drifting further away which each beat of the slowing heart.

_"No pulse... breathing shallow..."_

A brightness hovered just beyond sight, warmth spilling gently over closed eyelids. Around him, rhythmic beeps threaded into an uncertain melody, metallic yet comforting.

The cezve was warm again, he thought, smiling vaguely, tasting bitter coffee brewed fresh, and somewhere far away, gentle footsteps approached, whispering softly: Thursday, tomorrow, morning.
