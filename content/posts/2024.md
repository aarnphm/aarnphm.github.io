Hey [[posts/2023]] you,

I know that 2023 has been a tumultuous year, albeit a lot of things happened. You planned out
steps by steps what needs to be done in '24. You worried about maintaining friendship by hosting [[thoughts/atelier with friends|functions]], meeting new people.
Rest assured, we have kept up the tradition writing a "year-review" similar to previous years.

tl/dr: You achieve most of the things you set out to do for last year, with the main theme of "being-there".
