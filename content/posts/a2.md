> After reading this paper and in consideration of objective reality, subjective reality and legal fiction, do you think corporations should be regarded as separate legal “persons”? Do you agree with Prof. Thomas Donaldson’s vision of corporations as “moral” persons? Why or why not? How does the concept of corporate “personhood” influence our thinking about the social responsibilities of corporations? [@blair2015ofcorporations]
