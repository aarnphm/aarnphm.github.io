_Shade, oil on canvas - Frank Brangwyn, 1893_

It is 21:41, Oct 6th.

The wind is blowing out side, 61 deg felt like 53. The wall can felt the creaking sound of old bed frame moving.
The couple across the balcony was having sex, without having their shade pulled down. They know it, and sometimes we left each other bottle of wine. Maybe they like the attention.

They are in their early 30s, I invited them over for dinner a couple times, and they do as well.

I was just finished up my half-mugged coffee, finishing up Kant's Groundwork to Metaphysics of Morals.

It was a slow Sunday. I didn't do much, even though I have a few proposal to finish for that project, as well as cleaning up my place. I went to bed earlier last night, after visiting toronto and met H. H was filled with sunshine, and there is something mesmerising about her aura that makes me feel, full.
Not per say, I feel that the reason why I go to toronto so much is that I felt that was my home there. Recently broke up with this girl I met in Montreal during a summer visit. It felt like there was something there, but then the distance between us does make it harder.
(I travelled up there two-three weeks ago to hang with her, but seems like we just have two different lifestyles and intention in mind. She's doing her thing, and I guess I'm too.)

It is now 18:41, Oct  14th.

I did have a few assignments to finish. I tend to do a solid two hours of focus deep work, and followed by 30 mins of just randomly doing stuff (such as finishing this essay).
I often turn to book to find a balance or establish a state of tranquility.

I felt a rud within my mind. A barrier seemingly hard to escape. A fog covers my veil of existence. It felt like I'm just riding the storm. I let myself go through the feeling I teaed up with J this past summer (sorta head down, grind-y summer vibe to cope with the copious amount of feeling I didn't deal with.)
