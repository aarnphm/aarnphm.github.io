> similar to an [[books|antilibrary]], an anti-blockbusters is a collection of movies, short films that represents the art of film-making.

honourable mentions: [mubi](https://mubi.com/en/ca) and [a24](https://a24films.com/) are both awesome distributions and production companies that one should check out, (_if you have never heard about them_)

if you want a more complete list, check out [this entries on letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/bailey0/list/movies-everyone-tells-you-are-the-best-movies/)

## explore the collection
