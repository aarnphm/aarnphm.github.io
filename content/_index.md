I'm Aaron. Welcome to my humble abode!

Currently, I'm building efficient infrastructure for serving LLM and exploring
our interaction with machine learning models at [[dump/projects#bentoml--build-production-grade-ai-application|BentoML]].
What modality should we choose beyond text/chat for our interaction with these Large models (LMs)?
How can we make it more easy and accessible for everyone to utilise these models?

In the grand scheme of things, I care a lot about our interaction with machines and these systems, and what learning, and collaboration looks like in near future:
How can we build an [agentic](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/agentic-computing) ML systems that is playful and fun?

Sometimes, I might spontaneously drop everything and make music, or spent all days reading. Nevertheless, you can always reach out to me on `aarnphm[_]` on most platforms.

While coherency and somewhat abstract the 'about' page is, I hope to invite you on the journey of exploring these topics and hope you enjoy your stay.

The following are some links you might want to start with:
- [The bookshelf far away](/books): books I have read, currently reading, or to be read in near future.
- [The rusty mailbox](/posts/): collections of either personal or technical [[dump/writing|writing]].
- [An unfinished drawing canvas](/dump): Scattered recollection of notes.
- [Easels stand](/dump/projects): List of projects I have built throughout the year!

Regards, your internet friend Aaron.
