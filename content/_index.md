> _Our capacity to deal with [[dump/Language|language]] is a complex, genetically-determined part of our biological endowment. It's a product of evolution, part of our nature._ - Noam Chomsky

I'm [Aaron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6rZfpSL1RQ&ab_channel=SoylentJakob).

Currently, I'm building infrastructure for serving LLM and exploring
our interaction with machine learning models at [[dump/projects#bentoml--build-production-grade-ai-application|BentoML]].
What modality should we choose beyond [[dump/Language#representation.|text]]/chat for our interaction with these large models (LMs)? How can we make machine to reason?

You can always reach out to me on `aarnphm[_]` on most platforms.
