Beige and <span class="rose">ros√©</span> are my two favourite colours.

```telescopic id="intro"
* I try to be
* present.
  * present, but you will find
  *  me
    *  me either [[thoughts/writing#motivation.|writing]] or [[books|reading]].
    *  I enjoy
    *  to
      *  to take long walks
        *  nerd-snipping on [[/tags/math|math-related]] topics
          *  libraries
            *  people watching
              *  yuzu
                *  host [[thoughts/atelier with friends|functions]].
                *  Cooking is my [[/tags/love]]
                * language
                  * language, which I learn from my
                  * mom.
                    *  mom. How one cooks their eggs
                    *  tells me a lot
                    *  about
                      *  about how they treat others
                        *  about their cadence
                          *  about their internal [[thoughts/Agency|drive]].
```

```telescopic id="work"
* [[thoughts/work|open-source projects]] are overall net positive for
*  everyone
  *  everyone, so
  *  contribute.
    *  contribute. I believe
    *  in
      *  in
      *  [[thoughts/papers/Tools for Conviviality by Ivan Illich.pdf|tools]] that
      *  extend
        *  extend our [[thoughts/Agency|agency]].
```

```telescopic id="research"
* My research interests lie in
*  interpretability
  * interpretability ([[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability|inner working]] of a neural network),
  *  and ML system
    *  and [[thoughts/Machine learning|ML]] system (serving, evaluation, throughput, [[thoughts/optimization|optimization]]).
```

Currently, I'm building [serving infrastructure](https://bentoml.com) for [[/tags/ml]] systems, focusing on [[thoughts/LLMs|LLM]]'s [[thoughts/vllm|serving engine]].
