I'm Aaron. Welcome to my humble abode!

Currently, I'm building infrastructure for serving LLM and exploring
our interaction with machine learning models at [[dump/projects#bentoml--build-production-grade-ai-application|BentoML]].
What modality should we choose beyond text/chat for our interaction with these Large models (LMs)? How can we make machine to reason?

You can always reach out to me on `aarnphm[_]` on most platforms.

The following are some links that might be of interest to you:

- [Bookshelf](/books): books I have read, currently reading, or to be read in near future.
- [The rusty mailbox](/posts/): collections of either personal or technical [[dump/writing|writing]].
- [Notes](/dump): Scattered recollection of notes.
- [Easels stand](/dump/projects): List of [[dump/projects]] I have built throughout the year!
