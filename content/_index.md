Beige and <span class="rose">ros√©</span> are my two favourite colours.

[[thoughts/Chaos|Chaos]] induces [[thoughts/Agency|agency]] and satisfies the [[thoughts/Freud#The Ego and The Id|ego]]

My love language is cooking [[thoughts/Dishes|food]] for my friends. I try to be present, but you will find me either [[thoughts/writing#motivation.|writing]], [[books|reading]],

I think [[thoughts/work|open-source projects]] are overall a net positive for everyone, so contribute.

I'm pretty bullish on high [[thoughts/Agency|agency]] and fulfil one's [[thoughts/desire|desire]] in life.

Currently, I'm building [serving infrastructure](https://bentoml.com) for [[thoughts/Machine learning|ml]] systems and explore our interaction  through[[thoughts/large models|large models]].

I'm best reached [here](https://twitter.com/aarnphm_) or [`contact[at]aarnphm[dot]xyz`](mailto:contact@aarnphm.xyz).
