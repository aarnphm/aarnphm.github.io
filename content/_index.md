Beige and <span class="rose">ros√©</span> are my two favourite colours.

I try to be present, but you will find me either [[thoughts/writing#motivation.|writing]] or [[books|reading]].

I like taking long walks, hosting [[thoughts/Dishes|functions]], and people watching. I love cooking for people, which is how my mom expresses her love for me.
How one cooks their eggs tells a lot about how they treat others.

[[thoughts/work|open-source projects]] are overall net positive for everyone, so contribute.

I believe in tools that give back [[thoughts/Agency|agency]] to users and help them fulfil their [[thoughts/desire|desire]] in life.

Understanding the [[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability|inner working]] of large language models would help us to do better science.

<!-- I care a lot about what I work on, and fortunately, I got to work at what I care about most: formalising knowledge (software as a catalyst to achieve this dream). -->

Currently, I'm building [serving infrastructure](https://bentoml.com) for [[thoughts/Machine learning|ml]] systems and explore our interaction
through [[thoughts/LLMs|large language models]].

I'm best reached [here](https://twitter.com/aarnphm_) or contact@aarnphm.xyz.
