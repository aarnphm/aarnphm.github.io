Beige and <span class="rose">ros√©</span> are my two favourite colours.

[[thoughts/Chaos|Chaos]] induces [[thoughts/Agency|agency]] and satisfies the [[thoughts/Freud#The Ego and The Id|ego]]

My love language is cooking [[thoughts/Dishes|food]] for my friends. I try to be present, but you will find me either [[thoughts/writing#motivation.|writing]], [[books|reading]]

I think [[thoughts/work|open-source projects]] are overall a net positive for everyone, so contribute.

I'm pretty bullish on high [[thoughts/Agency|agency]] and fulfil one's [[thoughts/desire|desire]] in life.

Currently, I'm building [serving infrastructure](https://bentoml.com) for [[thoughts/Machine learning|ml]] systems and explore our interaction
through [[thoughts/LLMs|large language models]]. I do want debunk [[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability|internal representation]] of these models, given its black-box nature.

I'm best reached [here](https://twitter.com/aarnphm_) or [`contact[at]aarnphm[dot]xyz`](mailto:contact@aarnphm.xyz).

<!-- I'm looking for someone genuinely curious about the world who has achieved what I often refer to as a managed obsession with their craft. -->

<!-- Software is a net positive; our only limitation is our biological computer. A symbiotic relationship with silicon would significantly improve our capacity to ingest information flow and capture the essence of intelligence. -->

<!-- I do think consciousness is what you make of it. The values you gather through experience are curated largely based on your environment, and Zarathustra guides you on acting morally. People are innately good, but circumstances make them act a certain way.  -->

<!-- Heartbreaks are also what you make of them. Relationships teach you how to gently treat someone as one of your own; they also bash and crush your heart, as if the world is crumbling in front of your eyes. But it is okay; relationships are what we deem worth giving meaning to the absurdity of life. -->

<!-- I also like taking long walks and hosting functions. I love cooking for people, which is how my mom expressed her love to me. I don't think of working to make ends meet. I care a lot about what I work on, and fortunately, I got to work at what I care about most: formalising knowledge (software as a catalyst to achieve this dream). How one cooks their eggs tells a lot about how a person treats others. -->
