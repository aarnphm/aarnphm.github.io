Hi, my name is Aaron. I'm best reached via [twitter](https://twitter.com/aarnphm) or [email](mailto:contact@aarnphm.xyz).

I'm [[thoughts/craft|working]] at a [startup](https://bentoml.com) building #ml serving systems, where I mainly focus on [[thoughts/LLMs|LLM]] [[thoughts/vllm|inference engine]].

```

I would like to do [[research]] at some point. As far as [[thoughts/aesthetic value|aesthetic]] goes, I spend a lot of time [reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_reading) [[antilibrary|books]], watching [[cinematheque|cinema]], and [[vibes|collecting images]] on the internet ==outside of work==. This is my [[/dating|date-me doc]] if you are interested ✨
