Beige and <span class="rose">ros√©</span> are my two favourite colours.

[[thoughts/Chaos|Chaos]] induces [[thoughts/Agency|agency]] and satisfies the [[thoughts/Freud#The Ego and The Id|ego]]

I try to be present, but you will find me either [[thoughts/writing#motivation.|writing]] or [[books|reading]].

I also like taking long walks and hosting [[thoughts/Dishes|functions]]. I love cooking for people, which is how my mom expressed her love to me.
How one cooks their eggs tells a lot about how they treat others.

I think [[thoughts/work|open-source projects]] are overall a net positive for everyone, so contribute.

I'm pretty bullish on high [[thoughts/Agency|agency]] and fulfil one's [[thoughts/desire|desire]] in life.

Understanding the [[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability|internal representation]] of large language models would help us to do better science.

I care a lot about what I work on, and fortunately, I got to work at what I care about most: formalising knowledge (software as a catalyst to achieve this dream).
Currently, I'm building [serving infrastructure](https://bentoml.com) for [[thoughts/Machine learning|ml]] systems and explore our interaction
through [[thoughts/LLMs|large language models]].
