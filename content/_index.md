Beige and <span class="rose">ros√©</span> are my two favourite colours. [[thoughts/Chaos|Chaos]] pushes oneself to maximise their [[thoughts/Value|value]], construct the [[thoughts/Freud#The Ego and The Id|id]] and regulate the ego. I love treating my friends with [[thoughts/Dishes|good food]]. I [[thoughts/writing#motivation.|write]], [[books|read]], and maintain [[thoughts/work|open-source projects]].

I'm pretty bullish on high [[thoughts/Agency|agency]] and fulfil one's [[thoughts/desire|desire]] in life.

Currently, I'm building [serving infrastructure](https://bentoml.com) for [[thoughts/Machine learning|ml]] systems and explore our interaction with [[thoughts/large models|large models]].

You are currently at the _index_ of my [[thoughts/Hypertext|hypertext]] [[thoughts/Digital garden|digital garden]]. Feel free to explore around and let me know if you have any questions or just want to chat. I'm best reached [here](https://twitter.com/aarnphm_) or [`contact[at]aarnphm[dot]xyz`](mailto:contact@aarnphm.xyz).
