Welcome to my little digital garden. I'm Aaron, and I spend most of my time
building tools in open and training deep neural nets. This is my digital garden, or a data dump from my so-called biological cache.

## 📖 work.

Currently, I'm working as a software engineer at [BentoML](https://www.bentoml.com/),
a high performance frameworks to help data scientist ships their machine learning models
to production. On the side, I'm building developer tools and build system that evolves
around deep neural nets as well as experiment with a variety of languages 🦀 🐍 🐉 👻.

Outside of code, I'm learning French, taking photos and building keyboards 😄

I'm curious about how we can design better and more efficient infrastructure to run
algorithms at scale, improve interoperability between humans and machine and become more responsible technologist.

In the second decade of my life, I'm learning to be more unbiased about the world
around me, and have a better sleeping schedule.

## ❓ why.

I have been writing for a while, but never really got the courage and time to publish anything. Working has been taking most of my time, and I couldn't allocate time for writing. Recently, I have been experiencing insomnia and though it might sounds
horrible as it is, I started to pick up the pen and jot down my thoughts again. Digital
garden such as [Jacky's](https://jzhao.xyz), [swyx's](https://publish.obsidian.md/swyx/README), [Joel's](https://joelhooks.com/) inspires me a lot to finally publish those.

I found that I actually learn the most when I write, as it encourages me to read more
and actually explore on topics I want to learn more, so here we go 🚀

Since all my notes and thoughts are scattered amongs too many platforms (Slack, Discord, Notion, Apple Notes, Samsung Notes), it will take a while for me to move everything here, so please be patient 🐣

While I can't give you a tour of the garden, here are some of the links you can start
exploring:

- [Every so slightly blank canvas](/cache): Collection of thoughts that I jot down!
- [Exploration easel](/cache/Projects.md): List of projects I have built throughout the
  year!
- [The anti-procastination toolkit](/books): List of books I have read and currently
  reading!
