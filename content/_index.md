> _Our capacity to deal with [[dump/Language|language]] is a complex, genetically-determined part of our biological endowment. It's a product of evolution, part of our nature._ - Noam Chomsky

I'm [Aaron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6rZfpSL1RQ&ab_channel=SoylentJakob).

Currently, I'm building infrastructure for serving LLM and exploring
our interaction with machine learning models at [BentoML](https://bentoml.com/).
What modality should we choose beyond [[dump/Language#representation.|text]]/chat for our interaction with these large models (LMs)?

The following are some links that might be of interest to you:

- [shelf](/books): books I have read, currently reading, or to be read in near future.
- [rusty mailbox](/posts/): collections of either personal or technical [[dump/writing|writing]].
- [notes](/dump): Scattered recollection of notes.
- [easels stand](/dump/projects): List of projects I have built throughout the year!
- [diffuser](/dump/Scents): Scents I have used, currently using, or on wish-lists.
