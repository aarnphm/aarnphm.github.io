hi my name is aaron. I'm best reached via [twitter](https://twitter.com/aarnphm_) or [email](mailto:contact@aarnphm.xyz).

                                    * my [[/tags/love]] language
                                      * my love language, which I learn
                                      * from my mom.
                                        * from my mom. How one cooks their

                                          * eggs tells me a lot
                                          * about
                                            * about how they _treat others_

```telescopic id="research"
* as far as
* [[research]] interests go, I'm working
* on interpretability.
  * on interpretability ([[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability|inner working]] of a neural network)
  * of large ML system.
    * of large [[thoughts/Machine learning|ML]] system (inference engine [[thoughts/optimization|optimization]]).

  * On a higher level, I care
  * about building
    * about building [[thoughts/papers/Tools for Conviviality by Ivan Illich.pdf|tools]]
    * that extend
    * our agency
      * our agency to follow what one is drawn towards
        * our agency as a medium of [[thoughts/representations|expression]]
          * our [[thoughts/Agency|agency]] to fulfil one's [[thoughts/desire]] in life.
