Welcome to my little digital garden. I'm Aaron, and I spend most of my time
experimenting and building tools in open. This is my digital garden, or more likely
a data dump from my so-called biological backlog.

Currently, I'm working as a software engineer at [BentoML](https://www.bentoml.com/)
building a framework to make data scientist
