I'm Aaron. Welcome to my humble abode!

Currently, I'm building efficient infrastructure for serving LLM and exploring 
our interaction with machine learning models at [BentoML](https://www.bentoml.com/).
What modality should we choose beyond text/chat for our interaction with these Large models (LMs)? 
How can we make it more easy and accessible for everyone to utilise these models?

In the grand scheme of things, I care a lot about building interactions between
humans and machines, such that we have a freedom to create and investigate our curiosity:
What is [agentic](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/agentic-computing) ML?

Outside of code, I'm learning French, running a photography gig, and building
keyboards üòÑ

I'm curious about how we can design better and more efficient infrastructure to
run algorithms at scale, improve interoperability between living beings and
machine, and become more responsible technologist.

In the second decade of my life, I'm learning to be more unbiased about the
world around me, and have a better sleeping schedule.

I have been writing for a while, but never really got the courage and time to
publish anything. Working has been taking most of my time, and I couldn't
allocate time for writing. Recently, I have been experiencing insomnia and
though it might sounds horrible as it is, I started to pick up the pen and jot
down my thoughts again. Digital garden such as [Jacky's](https://jzhao.xyz),
[swyx's](https://publish.obsidian.md/swyx/README),
[Joel's](https://joelhooks.com/) inspires me a lot to finally publish those.

I found that I actually learn the most when I write, as it encourages me to read
more and actually explore on topics I want to learn more, so here we go üöÄ

Since all my notes and thoughts are scattered amongs too many platforms (Slack,
Discord, Notion, Apple Notes, Samsung Notes), it will take a while for me to
move everything here, so please be patient üê£

While I can't give you a tour of the garden, here are some of the links you can
start exploring:

- [The rusty mailbox](/posts/): collections of either personal or technical [[dump/writing|writing]].
- [Somewhat of a painted canvas](/dump): Scattered recollection of notes and dreams or whatnot.
- [Exploration easel](/dump/Projects.md): List of projects I have built throughout the year!
- [The second shelf](/books): books I have read, currently reading, or to be read in near future.
