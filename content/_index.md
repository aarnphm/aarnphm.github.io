I'm Aaron. Welcome to my humble abode!

Currently, I'm building efficient infrastructure for serving LLM and exploring
our interaction with machine learning models at [BentoML](https://www.bentoml.com/).
What modality should we choose beyond text/chat for our interaction with these Large models (LMs)?
How can we make it more easy and accessible for everyone to utilise these models?

In the grand scheme of things, I care a lot about humans and machines interaction, and what learning, and collaboration looks like in near future:
What is [agentic](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/agentic-computing) ML and how can we design playful interaction with these system?

While I can't give you a tour of the garden, here are some of the links you can start exploring:

- [The rusty mailbox](/posts/): collections of either personal or technical [[dump/writing|writing]].
- [An unfinished drawing canvas](/dump): Scattered recollection of notes.
- [Past life](/dump/projects): List of projects I have built throughout the year!
- [The bookshelf far away](/books): books I have read, currently reading, or to be read in near future.

Regards, your internet friend Aaron.
