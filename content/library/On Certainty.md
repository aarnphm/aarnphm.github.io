It would be an answer to say that this assertions or its opposite is ::misguided:: attempt to express something that _can't be expressed_ in this way

For one must come to see that what presents itself initially as the expression of a difficulty, or of its solutions, _may still be completely wrong {{sidenotes[expression]: What W is saying here is that for a person whose assumptions/criticisms towards a picture to be truthful/correct, he must have some ideas that hinges on assumptions of the propositions.}}._
