W abandoned the picture theory of the [[library/Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus|TLP]] for a therapeutic approach to philosophical problems.

PI dissolves confusions by examining how language actually works in practice.

## the turn from tractatus

early wittgenstein (Tractatus): language works by picturing reality. propositions have logical form that mirrors structure of facts. meaning is correspondence between linguistic elements and worldly elements.

later wittgenstein (PI): this picture-theory itself is confusion arising from looking at language in wrong way. meaning isn't hidden logical structure but visible use in practices. "don't think, but look!" (PI §66).

the revolution: meaning is use. "for a large class of cases—though not for all—in which we employ the word 'meaning' it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language" (PI §43).

implications cascade through philosophy:

- no essence of language (only family resemblances, §§65-67)
- no private language (meaning requires public criteria, §§243-315)
- no foundations (explanations end at bedrock of practices, §217)
- philosophy as therapy (dissolving confusions, not building theories, §§109-133)

## language games

central concept: "I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the activities into which it is woven, the 'language-game'" (PI §7).

examples (PI §23): giving orders, describing objects, reporting events, forming hypotheses, telling stories, play-acting, singing rounds, guessing riddles, making jokes, solving problems, translating, asking, thanking, cursing, greeting, praying.

each language game has:

- **rules** (often implicit): what moves are permitted, what counts as correct
- **point**: what the game is for, why people play it
- **criteria**: shared standards for applying concepts within the game
- **training**: how you learn to play (ostension, correction, imitation)

crucial: games are many and diverse. no single essence of language. different games work differently. philosophical confusion arises from expecting all language to work one way (usually: naming/describing).

language games are embedded in [[thoughts/forms of life|forms of life]]: "the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life" (PI §23). to understand meaning, you must understand the practice, the form of life in which language functions.

connection to [[library/Civilisation and its Discontents#exploratory connections freud and wittgenstein on language games|psychoanalysis]]: superego formation might be acquisition of particular language games—learning what can/can't be said, what's forbidden/permitted. moral prohibitions are transmitted linguistically, through participation in normative language games.

## family resemblance

why is there no essence of language? wittgenstein's famous analogy: games (§§66-67).

what's common to all games? nothing. some involve competition, others don't. some require skill, others luck. some are amusing, others serious. but they form a family—overlapping similarities, like familial resemblances (same nose, different eyes; same eyes, different build).

"we see a complicated network of similarities overlapping and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of detail" (PI §66).

this dissolves search for essences. instead of "what is X?" (demanding definition), ask: how does the concept work? what are its various uses? how do they relate?

applies to: language, game, number, knowledge, understanding, reading, thinking—most philosophically interesting concepts resist definition but function perfectly well through family resemblance.

implication: philosophical confusions often arise from demanding essence where there's only family resemblance. we think there must be something common to all cases of X, and when we can't find it, we posit mysterious abstract entity (platonism) or deny the concept's legitimacy (eliminativism). better: recognize family resemblance and stop demanding impossible unity.

## private language argument

one of philosophy's most discussed arguments (PI §§243-315). the target: idea that you could have language referring to private inner experiences—sensations, feelings, thoughts—that only you can know.

the claim: such purely private language is impossible. meaning requires public criteria.

the argument (simplified):

1. suppose you want to name a sensation—call it "S"
2. for "S" to be meaningful, you need criterion for correct application
3. criterion must distinguish cases where "S" applies from cases where it doesn't
4. in purely private language, only you can check whether you're using "S" correctly
5. but whatever seems right to you is right (no independent check)
6. where whatever seems right is right, we can't speak of "right" at all (PI §258)
7. therefore, "S" has no meaning; private language fails

the beetle in box analogy (PI §293): suppose everyone has a box containing something called "beetle." no one can look in anyone else's box. everyone says they know what beetle is by looking in their own box. but the thing in the box could be different for everyone, or constantly changing, or nothing at all. the word "beetle" functions in language game regardless of what's (if anything) in boxes. so the private object "cancels out"—it's irrelevant to meaning.

implications:

**for mind**: you can't give meaning to mental terms purely through private ostension (pointing inwardly). even most intimate experiences require public language learned through shared practices.

**for certainty**: you can't be certain about private experiences in way philosophy demands. "I know I'm in pain" is grammatical confusion—knowledge requires possibility of doubt, checking, verification. but pain just is what it seems to be, so "knowing" doesn't apply normally (PI §§246-250).

**for other minds**: skeptical problem dissolves. not that you infer others have minds from behavior. rather, psychological concepts are woven into our practices of responding to others. "an 'inner process' stands in need of outward criteria" (PI §580).

connection to [[library/Civilisation and its Discontents#private language argument and the unconscious|freud's unconscious]]: if private language is impossible, how can unconscious have meaning? maybe: unconscious content only becomes meaningful when articulated in therapy—when entered into psychoanalytic language game with public criteria (interpretation, confirmation, therapeutic efficacy).

## rule-following

how do you follow a rule? (PI §§185-242). seems simple but reveals deep puzzles.

the problem: any finite sequence of rule-applications is compatible with infinitely many different rules. how do you know you're following the same rule, not switching to different one?

famous example (PI §185): teaching someone to continue series "+2": 2, 4, 6, 8... student continues correctly to 1000, then writes 1004, 1008, 1012... has student misunderstood the rule? or understood different rule?

tempting answer: rule is represented mentally; you consult representation to determine correct application. but this just pushes problem back. how do you interpret the mental representation? that requires another rule (for interpretation), which requires another interpretation, infinite regress.

wittgenstein's response: rule-following is social practice, not private mental process. "to obey a rule, to make a report, to give an order, to play a game of chess, are customs (uses, institutions)" (PI §199).

you learn rules through training: correction, examples, practice. community maintains rules through agreement in judgments. when someone applies rule wrongly, others correct them. this shared practice grounds meaning—no private foundation needed.

"this was our paradox: no course of action could be determined by a rule, because every course of action can be made out to accord with the rule" (PI §201). resolution: "there is a way of grasping a rule which is not an interpretation, but which is exhibited in what we call 'obeying the rule' and 'going against it' in actual cases."

meaning is shown in practice, not determined by interpretation. you just act—trained responses, shared reactions, communal corrections. "when I obey a rule, I do not choose. I obey the rule blindly" (PI §219).

connection to [[thoughts/guilt|superego formation]]: [[library/Civilisation and its Discontents#rule-following and internalized norms|freud describes internalization]] of parental authority. you follow moral rules even alone because superego monitors you. but wittgenstein shows rule-following is inherently social—rules sustained by community correction. even private conscience is internalized social practice.

## bedrock: forms of life

"if I have exhausted the justifications I have reached bedrock, and my spade is turned. then I am inclined to say: 'this is simply what I do'" (PI §217).

explanations end somewhere. when you ask "why?" enough times, you reach practices that just are what we do. no deeper justification available or needed.

"what has to be accepted, the given, is—so one could say—forms of life" (PI p. 226).

[[thoughts/forms of life|forms of life]] are shared ways of living—practices, reactions, judgments—that ground language games and make meaning possible. they're not chosen or justified; they're the framework within which choice and justification operate.

"can only say: this language-game is played" (PI §654). you can describe the practice, examine its workings, trace its implications. but you can't get behind it to explain why this practice rather than another. at some point: this is just what we do.

implications:

**humility**: your practices aren't rationally grounded all the way down. they could be otherwise. what seems obvious to you is contingent on your form of life.

**pluralism**: different communities might have different forms of life, therefore different meanings, values, possibilities. no god's-eye view to adjudicate.

**limits of critique**: you can criticize from within form of life (internal tensions, consequences) or by comparison with other forms of life. but no absolute standpoint outside all forms of life.

connection to [[library/Civilisation and its Discontents#forms of life and the reality principle|freud's reality principle]]: learning to accept constraints, defer gratification, operate within limits. but "reality" that constrains isn't objective natural fact—it's social practices, forms of life. different civilizations (different forms of life) have different reality principles.

## philosophy as therapy

radical reconception of philosophy's task (PI §§109-133):

**not**: discovering hidden truths, building theories, solving problems

**but**: dissolving confusions, untangling conceptual knots, bringing words back from metaphysical to everyday use

"philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language" (PI §109).

"what is your aim in philosophy?—to shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle" (PI §309).

philosophical problems arise from misunderstanding how language works. we're captivated by certain pictures (language as naming, meaning as mental states, truth as correspondence) that work in some contexts but mislead when generalized. philosophy's job: free us from these captivating pictures.

method: "don't think, but look!" (PI §66). examine actual use. assemble reminders of how language functions. arrange what we already know differently. "we lead words back from their metaphysical to their everyday use" (PI §116).

goal: "the clarity we are aiming at is indeed complete clarity. but this simply means that the philosophical problems should completely disappear" (PI §133).

controversial implications:

**anti-theoretical**: philosophy doesn't discover new facts or build explanatory theories. "philosophy simply puts everything before us, and neither explains nor deduces anything" (PI §126).

**quietism**: "philosophy may in no way interfere with the actual use of language; it can in the end only describe it" (PI §124). seems to rule out criticism, reform, political philosophy.

**therapeutic**: problems dissolve when you see clearly how language works. not solving problems but dissolving them by showing they rest on confusion.

but also potential for radicalism: once you see your practices are contingent (just one form of life among possibilities), you can imagine alternatives. therapy can be political—freeing people from captivating pictures that naturalize oppression.

## aspect-seeing and gestalt shifts

part II of PI (formerly part II, now often called "philosophy of psychology"): discusses seeing aspects, experiencing meaning, duck-rabbit figure.

the duck-rabbit: can be seen as duck or rabbit, but not both simultaneously. the figure doesn't change; your aspect shifts.

this illuminates: "dawning of aspect," "seeing as," noticing features. meaning isn't just reference but how you take something, aspect under which you see it.

"seeing as" isn't voluntary but isn't purely passive either. you can't see duck and rabbit simultaneously, but you can shift between them. neither is "really" there—both are genuine aspects available in the figure.

connection to [[library/Civilisation and its Discontents#showing vs saying in symptoms|therapeutic process]]: maybe therapy works through enabling new aspect-seeing. you see your symptom under different aspect, participate in different language game around it. not discovering what symptom "really means" (no fact of the matter) but learning to see/describe differently in ways that reduce suffering.

broader implication: understanding isn't just grasping facts but seeing things under appropriate aspects. same facts can be understood differently depending on which aspects you notice, which connections you make, which language games you participate in.

## key aphorisms

PI is full of memorable, cryptic aphorisms worth contemplating:

"don't think, but look!" (§66)—against theorizing, toward examining actual use

"what is your aim in philosophy?—to shew the fly the way out of the fly-bottle" (§309)—philosophy as therapy

"if a lion could talk, we could not understand him" (p. 223)—forms of life ground understanding

"whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" (tractatus 7)—early wittgenstein's mysticism

"what can be shown cannot be said" (tractatus 4.1212)—showing vs. saying distinction

"philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language" (§109)—captivating pictures mislead

"an 'inner process' stands in need of outward criteria" (§580)—against private language

"this language-game is played" (§654)—bedrock, no further justification

## contemporary relevance

PI's insights remain vital:

**cognitive science**: challenges internalist pictures of mind. meaning isn't mental representation but use in practices. embodied, embedded, extended cognition all indebted to wittgenstein.

**philosophy of mind**: dissolves traditional mind-body problem, private language, other minds skepticism. shows these arise from conceptual confusion, not empirical ignorance.

**social theory**: language games and forms of life illuminate how meaning is socially constituted. relevant to social construction, practice theory, situated cognition.

**ethics**: forms of life ground moral understanding. no foundations beyond practices. relevance to particularism, anti-foundationalism, pragmatism in ethics.

**AI and understanding**: if meaning requires participation in forms of life, what does this mean for artificial intelligence? can language models understand without living? or just simulate understanding through pattern-matching?

**political philosophy**: therapeutic approach can denaturalize oppressive practices by showing their contingency. or can seem quietist, accepting what is. ongoing debate about PI's political implications.

## interpretive controversies

PI is notoriously difficult, admits multiple readings:

**resolute vs. substantial**: does PI offer positive philosophical views (meaning as use, forms of life as bedrock)? or is it purely therapeutic, rejecting all philosophical theses?

**quietist vs. activist**: does therapy leave everything as it is (describing without criticizing)? or does exposing contingency enable change?

**realist vs. anti-realist**: does wittgenstein think there are mind-independent facts that language describes? or is "reality" itself constituted by practices?

**foundationalist vs. anti-foundationalist**: are forms of life foundations (bedrock that grounds meaning)? or is wittgenstein denying need for foundations altogether?

**communitarian vs. individualist**: does emphasis on social practices eliminate individual variation? or is there space for personal interpretation within shared forms of life?

likely: PI resists these dichotomies. wittgenstein wants to dissolve the frameworks that generate such either/or questions. but this makes him frustratingly elusive—different readers find different wittgensteins.

## connections to explore

- relationship to [[thoughts/hermeneutics|hermeneutics]]: both emphasize interpretation, context, practices. but tensions around foundations and relativism
- relevance to [[thoughts/performativity|performativity theory]]: language games as performances that constitute meaning
- implications for [[thoughts/identity|identity]]: you become yourself within forms of life, through participation in language games
- connection to pragmatism: james, dewey, rorty all influenced by wittgenstein's turn to practice
- tension with psychoanalysis: wittgenstein skeptical of depth psychology, hidden causes, unconscious. but both offer therapeutic approaches to dissolving confusion

philosophical investigations doesn't answer philosophy's traditional questions—it questions the questions. by examining how language actually works in practices, wittgenstein aims to dissolve problems that arise from misunderstanding our own linguistic tools. whether this constitutes progress, evasion, or something else entirely remains contested. but the text's influence is undeniable—it changed how philosophy understands meaning, mind, and method.
