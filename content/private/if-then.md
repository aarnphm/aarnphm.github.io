1. How do we want to show up for ourself?

- Come with prep for others' people work to help them further their progress

- Come prepared with the work I have done for the project
- Be accountable with the project I'm building, hoping to learn more about a new field that I'm interested in (interpretability for ml)

- Testing out new papers and research ideas
- Prototype new paradigms for interactions with these ML systems to improve our productivity

2. How we want to show up for each other?

- actively listening and be presents with respectful and constructive feedback
- create spaces for development and experimentation

- Offering help and support for others if they come accross any problems
- embracing learning opportunities through constructive feedback

### brigid

mimic, corrupt of twitter threads, haunted media

Ghost in machine

Site as realisation from nostalgia

Twitter thread: be a kid again

- 3 things you learned/that struck you
  - reminds me of [Ted Chiang's blog for LLMs](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web), in a sense that LLMs have innate corruption policy
  - travesty generator
  - punctuation ablation
- 2 things you have a question about
  - How do you introduce more entropy or randomness in the generation?
  - semantically are there any relevance between these generations?
- 1 concrete suggestion
  - introduce some entropy into generations?

### jessica

_film visualisation of tensions and questions in computational poetry_

note: mediate in integrations of technology with writers/poets

influence: cinematech, sf => phonetic energy in the film.

#### Deception, consent, and interrogation

- Barry Schwabsky wrote about see "his" poetry in 3700+ page anthology
- Yasusasa Poet scandal (fake Japanese poet to deceived people)
- Carly's paper: No LLM trained on "consensually collected writting of creative writers."

#### lineage

- influences and intellectual lineage of a writer's work
- influence us are not compensated by us, distinguishing this from all the "influences" that ML model
- represents intermediate representations in film

#### generated content

- simulacra: synthetic data

- 3 things you learned/that struck you
  - reminds of Paul Graham's [writes and write-nots](https://paulgraham.com/writes.html), in a sense that how we write is showing how we think
  - reminds me of [Ted Chiang's blog for LLMs](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web), in a sense that LLMs have innate corruption policy: Source of truth becomes blurry
  - Showing lineage through film is very interesting, in a sense we interpret film better uch that we have better understanding of said models.
- 2 things you have a question about
  - computation writing, history as a good enough generated-contents
  - philosophical speaking, where we want to think about how we write.
- 1 concrete suggestion
  - machine consciousness, why context for why we write?
  - highlight knowledges difference and representations in these models
  - immediate influence in our life, to determine vibes (context, uniqueness)
