1. How do we want to show up for ourself?

- Come with prep for others' people work to help them further their progress

- Come prepared with the work I have done for the project
- Be accountable with the project I'm building, hoping to learn more about a new field that I'm interested in (interpretability for ml)

- Testing out new papers and research ideas
- Prototype new paradigms for interactions with these ML systems to improve our productivity

2. How we want to show up for each other?

- actively listening and be presents with respectful and constructive feedback
- create spaces for development and experimentation

- Offering help and support for others if they come accross any problems
- embracing learning opportunities through constructive feedback
