Evan Conrad

Sorta trading platform for GPU renting

pitch: cloud provider

(Evan and Alex)

- run AI grant =>
- nobody sells for week/week (couldn't buy < year)
- GPU cloud => lenders => (business models) => year-long contract
- high interest rates ($cost/h)
- loan based on capital

buy for a year then sell every months that loan per months

financial parties => balance sheets (hedge risks to run clusters, finance do the bet)

hedge fund to offset the risks <== (traders): build exchange

block of compute to trade around (exchange)

regulated market makers for traders (jane street) to trade cloud compute

10 vendors (GPU clusters) that is not owned by AWS, GCP, Azure

power market (own compute to trade) <== arbitrage between longer vendors

Looking for folks at higher level for inference stack

NCCL and CUDA
