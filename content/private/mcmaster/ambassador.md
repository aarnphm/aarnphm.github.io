Reasons for embassador:

> Management suits people with high agency who know what they want to do.
> For me, the reason why I chose Management is that it somewhat introduced me to the startup space, where you have to think a lot more beyond technical requirements.
> Though I will be frank, I wish there were someone in my first year who could be more direct with how the programs are structured or explain more about what
> I got myself into since this is not for everyone. Therefore, I want to be this person.
