> Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time, across projects.

This terms is initially coined by [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX) where he argues that most people only takes transient notes.
Evergreen notes require a cadence of continually updates information over times. One can also use `git` as an act to track history/updates to said notes.
