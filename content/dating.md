Most people know me as `aarnphm`, but you can call me _Aaron_ (or [A-A-Ron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRpsRKuyi3Y&ab_channel=ComedyCentralUK)).

I was born in 2001 and I'm currently an [[thoughts/Transformers#inference.|inference]] optimization [[/|engineer]] at [bentoml](https://bentoml.com/)â€”which means I'm a software engineer working on optimizing [[thoughts/LLMs|LLMs]]â€”based in Toronto, Canada.

This document doesn't represent the whole me, but it should give you a sense of the "non-tech" version of who I am and what I do in my downtime.

I hate dating apps. I know it's a numbers game, but I got lazy and tired of the repetition and algorithms, so I decided to make this insteadâ€”something I can share with someone I find attractive.

I'm hoping to find a wonderful woman to be my partner [^partner], someone I can share a life with for many years to come ðŸ’•

[^partner]: And I meant, [wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife).

## about me.

Here is what my friends' attestation of me:

```quotes
Caring, inquisitive, loyal, thoughtful  -- N
```

```quotes
[Aaron] is someone with very kind and warm energy. I always appreciate seeing you. -- T
```

```quotes
I think that Aaron is someone I trust to be there for me at the drop of a hat, no matter if itâ€™s 3pm on a sunday or 3am on a weeknight. Aaron is very attentive and will do everything in his power to make you feel loved and cared for. Heâ€™s willing to go to great lengths to make people feel special and he has great taste and great musings that promise good conversations and a good time. -- C
```

I'm a _honest_ person, and I'm not afraid to admit to mistakes. I'm sure I'll make _even more mistakes_, but no one is âœ¨ _perfect_ âœ¨ and we only have one life to live ðŸ™‚

I try to live this life well. I'm pretty goofy around my friends and people I trust. That said, I find myself drawn to more spontaneous people, probably because I tend to be more reserved. _Well_:

![[thoughts/images/me-in-yosemite.webp|this is a campfire near Half Dome on the Yosemite Falls trail]]

I'm someone you can rely on[^1] --when I make a commitment to you, I'll be 100% present.

[^1]: reliable in both logistics and emotional capacity, but I'm still human at the end of the day.

## professional life.

<figure class='float-right'>

![[thoughts/images/me-at-htn.webp|This is also me at Hack The North]]

</figure>

I'm rather attentive and assiduous in my [[thoughts/craft|work]]. Back in 2018, I interned at the business analytics division of a Vietnamese bank, doing behavioral analysis on customer usage patterns.
This was my first real exposure to [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) and I was immediately hooked.

I lacked the skills and knowledge at the time, but that didn't bother me muchâ€”I found the problem space fascinating and knew I would _try_ to solve it. Not because someone _asked me to_, but because _I wanted to_.

Early on, I noticed that most of [[thoughts/Machine learning|ML]]'s [technical debt](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf) comes down to scaling, inherently an _engineering_ problem.
This led me to join my current startup, as a software engineer.
The mission statement has shifted quite a bit since then, but the core remains the same: optimizing [[thoughts/LLMs|statistical models]] to be as fast and accessible as possible.

My approach to problems has stayed consistent since I learned arithmetic: ==don't quit, managed obsession [^obsession], and get your hands dirty== [^work].

[^work]: I should say I've been very fortunate professionallyâ€”working at a startup meant tackling loosely-defined problems and developing my own research and engineering [[thoughts/taste]].

[^obsession]: Allocating 15-20 minutes a day to _one_ problem, without distraction. These days it's often 30-60 minute stints for me. Claude and Gemini have become useful "researcher" when I want to dive deeper into interesting topics.

I might not be good at something initially, but this modus operandi has allowed me to work on what's probably the hardest [problem](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) of our time--_scaling intelligence_

I do want to pursue research at some point. Right now I'm dabbling with [[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability]], topological manifolds, and number theory.

## personal life.

That said, I care deeply about the well-being of the people around me. My [headspace](https://notes.aarnphm.xyz) has been occupied with a lot lately, but I always try to stay present and make time for the people in my life.
This might be connected to something else, thoughâ€”I moved abroad at 17 to study at a private all-boys boarding school in Vancouver, and I think that left me more anxious than I'd like to admit [^being-human].

My mom says I was always shy growing up. These days I'm much more social, though I suppose the right word is ambivert: I'm comfortable in social settings, but I also deeply value my alone time.

[^being-human]: Regardless, this was life-changing, as it taught me a lot about [[thoughts/being]] _human_.

[[influence|Friends]] mean the world to me. I'd go so far as to say that my understanding of relationshipsâ€”of care itselfâ€”has been shaped entirely by my friendships. In _Nicomachean Ethics, VIII_, Aristotle wrote:

```sms
One cannot be a friend to many people in the sense of having friendship of the perfect type with them, just as one cannot be in love with many people at once (for love is a sort of excess of feeling, and it is the nature of such only to be felt towards one person); and it is not easy for many people at the same time to please the same person very greatly, or perhaps even to be good in his eyes.
```

I love my friends deeplyâ€”so much that I'd willingly take a bullet for any of them, at any moment.
There are no ulterior motives here; everything I do comes from genuine intention.
When I find something really cool and share it with someone, it's because they're the first person who comes to mind.
Part of me wishes that one day I'll be able to give each of them the time and energy they truly deserve.

![[thoughts/images/C8F817FA-8961-4287-8318-B45FCA5D7E67.webp|A scene in "Lost in Translation (2003)". I do sometimes, think about the time I wronged my friends. But it happened for a reason, and we learnt to grow from our mistakes.]]

So, yes, I _care_. I care a lot about people, both in its abstract and physical form. I try my hardest to amplify those around me and give them space to grow and achieve what they want in _life_ (also another thing my dear mom taught me ðŸ™‚)

## what i like doing.

I have an attention-span of a three-year-old, but an old soul (some said). So I like to explore and do a lot of things.

<section data-activities>

Bouldering

- I climb V3-V5 most days. I still have a lot to improve, technique and strength-wise. My goal is to comfortably climb V7-V8 [^climbing].

</section>

[^climbing]: Grading varies from gym-to-gym. I mostly climb at Joe's Rock, which their grading systems somewhat follows [Olympic standard for grades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_climbing_at_the_Summer_Olympics)

<section data-activities>

Cooking

- I love food. There's something mystical about Michelin-starred chefs dedicating their entire lives to perfecting the art of food making.
- Food nourishes the soul, and cookingâ€”working on a dish from start to finishâ€”feels deeply rewarding.
- It's also how I show love to my friends.
- I [[thoughts/atelier with friends|host]] dinners regularly, mostly centered around French and Italian cuisine.
  - These are usually four-course meals for 4-6 people, and at the end, you can pay me _whatever you think the meal is worth_.
  - I try to accommodate allergies and dietary restrictions, though the range of food I cook can make that challenging.
- Every week I make fresh tortellini [^stuff-pasta], VeloutÃ© [^mother-sauce], and tagliatelle [^shape]â€”this is my form of therapy.
- I'm conscious about what I eat and try to substitute for organic ingredients when possible.
- I do follow a carnivore diet myself, but I'm happy to cook anything.
- I learned how to [[uses#cookware.|cook]] through books (Alice Waters and Thomas Keller's), observing chef [^stage] friends, and my mom.

</section>

[^mother-sauce]: Considered one of the "mother sauces" by legendary chef Auguste Escoffier

[^stuff-pasta]: rotation of fillings includes ricotta-based, mushroom, and meat-based. I try to make this at least once a month, depending on how busy life gets.

[^shape]:
    The pasta I make varies in shape, but it's always uovo pastaâ€”egg-based pasta made with a mix of 00-flour and semolina flour. I usually go for 80-20, but you can go without semolina. Note that semolina is based on durum wheat, so for folks that got allergy, I tend to exclude semolina.

    I hit the farmers' market every Sunday morning to get the freshest eggs possible. Ideally, the yolks should be super orange (I know this is hard to find in Ontario), but slightly yellow yolks work fine too.

    For trickier shapes like buccatini, I use the stand mixer to roll and cut the dough. Otherwise, I always roll by hand. Here's a recipe I've found that works well for four servings:

    - $\frac{3}{2}$ cups of flour | 227 grams (mixed at ratio mentioned above)
    - 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
    - 3 yolks + 1 whole eggs
    - distilled water (or any sort of water that has pH <= 7) to smooth the dough.

    You can use a food processor to mix the dough (this is the most efficient way to do this, if you are short in time). However, I prefer the traditional way, which is making a well, and develop the gluten by hand.

[^stage]: I want to stage at a restaurant nearby, but having trouble to find a gig to do so.

<section data-activities>

Vinyl/[[movies|Movies]]

- I collect [[mixed#vinyl]] and produced throwaway tunes in my free time.
  ![[posts/images/2023-flac-1.mp3]]
- Music is a huge part of my lifeâ€”I honestly wouldn't be able to function without it.
- I prefer classical orchestra, a mix of blues and jazz, 80s rock, and I have a deep appreciation for house and garage culture.
- A bit of a cinemaphile

Design/Fashion/Watches

- I [[/|designed this site you're on]], for example
  - I hate building websites, but I can't stand a badly designed one.
- I enjoy [[thoughts/fashion|timeless pieces]] and have started developing a taste for [[thoughts/furnitures|furniture]].
  - My main design philosophy inspiration includes Bauhaus and Kanso (ç°¡ç´ )
- I follow Fashion Week quite extensively, especially NYFW and Milan Fashion Week
  - Collina Strada and Sandy Liang are a few favorites of mine lately.
- I also have a watch collection and a bit of a horology nerd.

Writing/Reading

- One of the main reasons I publish and open-source my garden is because I want to share my writing.
- I mainly write for myself and collect items from across the internet for archival purposes.
  - I use [curius](curius.app) to save links on the go, but often transfer them back here later.
  - If you're interested in [[colophon|how this website was built]]
- I find essay and fiction formats very refreshing.
  - I'm heavily influenced by Michel Foucault, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Franz Kafka, and Raymond Carver's writing.
- I also maintain a [[books|antilibrary]] of literature that I've enjoyed.
- I read [[are.na#papers]] and textbooks for fun sometimes.
  - Yes, I know.

## compatibility.

<section data-compat>

Possible deal-breakers

1. I don't want kids, at least for the next five years.

- That said, I'd make it work for the _right_ person.

2. My past relationship was polyamorous, but I'm open to monogamy. I found that my work schedule fits well with that style of romantic attachment, and I'm definitely not the jealous type. Though my previous partner and I ended on a sour note, I'm more than happy with the growth.
3. I care deeply about my friends, and I believe that as partners, we don't have to do everything together. I definitely want to spend the majority of my time with you, but I'll need "boys" time.
4. Most of my friends are female. I have very clear boundaries that I never cross with friends, but I want all my female friendshipsâ€”especially with N and Câ€”to remain strong.
5. I currently live in Toronto, Canada. I'm open to long-distance (but prefer not to) if there's a good chance we'd end up in the same city, assuming everything goes well. San Francisco, Berkeley, San Jose, New York, and Boston are all possibilities.

- I plan to move back to the US soon, but for the foreseeable future, I'll be based in Toronto.

</section>

<section data-compat>

What I'm offering in a relationship

1. I'm cautiously optimistic, sometimes a bit self-deprecating.
2. My attachment style has always been ["securely attached"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory#Attachment_styles_in_adults:~:text=%5B116%5D-,Securely%20attached,-%5Bedit%5D), though I found that my previous partner was ["anxious-preoccupied"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory#Attachment_styles_in_adults:~:text=%5B118%5D-,Anxious%2Dpreoccupied,-%5Bedit%5D). I'm a caregiver at heart, so I definitely want to look after you.
3. I will cook for you. You don't have to come into the kitchen, but you're more than welcome to join.
4. My [love languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Love_Languages) are physical touch, gifts, and quality time. I think of a life _partner_ as someone you're mutually supportive of and committed toâ€”someone you're building something together with.
5. I will cook for you.

What I'm looking for in a partner

By all means, this is _not all checkbox that I'm looking for_, but good signals for a good relationship:

1. Driven, high empathy, emotional maturity
2. Witty / Sharp
3. We can meanders about nothing for hours
4. Confidence or being in STEM is _sooooooo attractive to me_
5. Non-avoidance attachment style
6. Spontaneous and adventurous soul
7. Si vous parlez franÃ§ais, fantastique je t'aime
8. Open-minded, with a bit of je ne sais quoi, fabuleuse

</section>

If this sounds like _you_

I'd love to:

1. Take you out on a picnic date where we can rent a VHS and eat strawberry, or
2. We can go bouldering, grab food, then spend the night watching Paris, Texas, or
3. Rent a cabin near Lake Simcoe, and enjoy the nature.
