title: dating me.
pageLayout: letter
---

This document doesn't represent the whole me, but it should give you a sense of the "non-tech" version of who I am and what I do in my downtime.

I hate dating apps. I know it's a numbers game, but I got lazy and tired of the repetition and algorithms, so I decided to make this insteadâ€”something I can share with someone I find attractive.

I'm hoping to find a wonderful woman to be my partner [^partner], someone I can share a life with for many years to come â™¥

[^partner]: And I meant, [wife](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife).

![[thoughts/images/selfie-1.webp]]
![[thoughts/images/me-in-park.webp]]

<div id="tldr">

Here's 30 second about me. By all means explore the rest of the documents.

I'm a [[thoughts/LLMs|software]] engineer working on language models, but do have a knack for cooking: I make fresh pasta (tortellini, tagliatelle) every Sunday, veloutÃ© and beef stocks from time to time. I collect vinyl, climb V5s, and read math textbooks.

I'm a bit obsessive with my work, especially [[thoughts/Machine learning|machine learning]] model. It is all I think about these days, other than caring for my friends and people in my life ofc.

Friends say I'm the 3am call who shows up.

I moved continents at a young age, and learnt very early on that _solitude makes presence precious_.

I like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rachmaninoff</span> and garage culture, and spending time delving into random rabbit-hole. I also practice "managed obsession" [^managed-obesssion]

Looking for someone equally comfortable discussing Wittgenstein (or [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]) over homemade pasta,
high empathy, witty and sharp, non-avoidance attachment style, to plan spontaneous cabin escapes.

[^managed-obesssion]: more of a time-block allocation thingy. I spend around 15-30 mins a day working on something I care about deeply. Right now, it is [[thoughts/Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] by [[thoughts/Wittgenstein]]

five years plan: No kids, for now. I value my relationship with my female friends. I'm based in Toronto, but US-bound eventually.

## about me.

Here is my friends' attestation of me:

```quotes
Caring, inquisitive, loyal, thoughtful  -- N
```

```quotes
[Aaron] is someone with very kind and warm energy. I always appreciate seeing you. -- T
```

```quotes
I think that Aaron is someone I trust to be there for me at the drop of a hat, no matter if itâ€™s 3pm on a sunday or 3am on a weeknight. [aaron] is very attentive and will do everything in his power to make you feel loved and cared for. Heâ€™s willing to go to great lengths to make people feel special and he has great taste and great musings that promise good conversations and a good time. -- C
```

I'm a _honest_ person, and I'm not afraid to admit to mistakes. I'm sure I'll make _even more mistakes_, but no one is âœ¨ _perfect_ âœ¨ and we only have one life to live ðŸ™‚

I try to live this life well. I'm pretty goofy around my friends and people I trust. That said, I find myself drawn to more spontaneous people, probably because I tend to be more reserved. _Well_:

![[thoughts/images/me-in-yosemite.webp|this is a campfire near Half Dome on the Yosemite Falls trail]]

I'm someone you can rely on[^1] --when I make a commitment to you, I'll be 100% present.

[^1]: reliable in both logistics and emotional capacity, but I'm still human at the end of the day.

I want to build a farm one day, and a high believer in lab-grown meat [^lab-grown]

[^lab-grown]:
    This will be one of the most important innovation in the 21st century. Though, I would still want to raise cattle ethically.

    Note that when I refers to "direct B2C", I would expect having 3-4 families to share a cow. In this case, it would be a lot cheaper for each family comparing to getting their stock at Costco.

Most people know me online as `aarnphm` /urn-fm/, but you can call me _Aaron_ (or [a-a-ron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRpsRKuyi3Y&ab_channel=ComedyCentralUK)).

I'm currently an [[thoughts/Transformers#inference.|inference]] optimization [[/|engineer]] at [bentoml](https://bentoml.com/), which means I'm a software engineer working on optimizing [[thoughts/LLMs|LLMs]], based in Toronto, Canada.

## professional life.

<figure class='float-right'>

![[thoughts/images/me-at-htn.webp|This is also me at Hack The North]]

</figure>

I'm rather attentive and assiduous in my [[thoughts/craft|work]]. I interned at the business analytics division of a bank back in 2018, doing behavioral analysis on customer usage patterns.
This was my first real exposure to [supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning) and I was immediately hooked.

I lacked the skills and knowledge at the time, but that didn't bother me much: I found the problem space fascinating and knew I would _try_ to solve it. Not because someone _asked me to_, but because _I wanted to_.

Early on, I noticed that most of [[thoughts/Machine learning|ML]]'s [technical debt](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2015/file/86df7dcfd896fcaf2674f757a2463eba-Paper.pdf) comes down to scaling, which inherently is an _engineering_ problem.
This led me to join my current startup, as a software engineer.
The mission statement has shifted quite a bit since then, but the core remains the same: optimizing [[thoughts/LLMs|statistical models]] to be as fast and accessible as possible.

My approach to problems has stayed consistent since I learned arithmetic: ==don't quit, managed obsession [^obsession], and get your hands dirty== [^work].

[^work]: I should say I've been very fortunate professionally, working at a startup meant tackling loosely-defined problems and developing my own research and engineering [[thoughts/taste]].

[^obsession]: Allocating 15-20 minutes a day to _one_ problem, without distraction. These days it's often 30-60 minute stints for me. Claude, Gemini, GPT-5, Kimi K2, GLM, DeepSeek R1 have all become useful "researchers"/"curators"/"verifiers" that helps me delve into a rabbit-hole.

I might not be good at something initially, but this modus operandi has allowed me to work on what's probably the hardest [problem](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) of our time--_scaling intelligence_

> I know that the next section on my research interest can be a bit long, feel free to skip it! Otherwise hopefully it captures topics I'm currently fascinated with (as of oct, 2025)

## personal life.

<figure class="float-left">

![[thoughts/images/before-sunset.webp|This could be us, "Before Sunset (2004)".]]

</figure>

That said, I care deeply about the well-being of the people around me. My [headspace](https://notes.aarnphm.xyz) has been occupied with a lot lately, but I always try to stay present and make time for the people in my life.

This might be connected to something else, thoughâ€”I moved abroad at 17 to study at a private all-boys boarding school in Vancouver, and I think that left me more anxious than I'd like to admit [^being-human].

My mom says I was always shy growing up. These days I'm much more social, though I suppose the right word is _ambivert_: I'm comfortable in social settings, but I also deeply value my alone time.

[^being-human]: Regardless, this was life-changing, as it taught me a lot about [[thoughts/being]] _human_.

[[influence|Friends]] mean the world to me. I'd go so far as to say that my understanding of relationshipsâ€”of care itselfâ€”has been shaped entirely by my friendships. In _Nicomachean Ethics, VIII_, Aristotle wrote:

```sms
One cannot be a friend to many people in the sense of having friendship of the perfect type with them, just as one cannot be in love with many people at once (for love is a sort of excess of feeling, and it is the nature of such only to be felt towards one person); and it is not easy for many people at the same time to please the same person very greatly, or perhaps even to be good in his eyes.
```

I love my friends deeplyâ€”so much that I'd willingly take a bullet for any of them, at any moment.
There are no ulterior motives here; everything I do comes from genuine intention.
When I find something really cool and share it with someone, it's because they're the first person who comes to mind.
Part of me wishes that one day I'll be able to give each of them the time and energy they truly deserve.

![[thoughts/images/C8F817FA-8961-4287-8318-B45FCA5D7E67.webp|A scene in "Lost in Translation (2003)". I do sometimes, think about the time I wronged my friends. But it happened for a reason, and we learnt to grow from our mistakes.]]

So, yes, I _care_. I care a lot about people, both in its abstract and physical form. I try my hardest to amplify those around me and give them space to grow and achieve what they want in _life_ (also another thing my dear mom taught me ðŸ™‚)

## what i like doing.

I have the attention-span of a three-year-old, but an old soul (some said). So I like to explore and do a lot of things.

<section data-activities>

bouldering

- I climb V3-V5 most days. I still have a lot to improve, technique and strength-wise. My goal is to comfortably climb V7-V8 [^climbing].

</section>

[^climbing]: Grading varies from gym-to-gym. I mostly climb at Joe's Rock, which their grading systems somewhat follows [Olympic standard for grades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_climbing_at_the_Summer_Olympics)

<section data-activities>

cooking

- I love food. There's something mystical about Michelin-starred chefs dedicating their entire lives to perfecting the art of food making.
- Food nourishes the soul, and cookingâ€”working on a dish from start to finishâ€”feels deeply rewarding.
- It's also how I show love to my friends.
- I [[thoughts/atelier with friends|host]] dinners regularly, mostly centered around French and Italian cuisine.
  - These are usually four-course meals for 4-6 people, and at the end, you can pay me _whatever you think the meal is worth_.
  - I try to accommodate allergies and dietary restrictions, though the range of food I cook can make that challenging.
- Every week I make fresh tortellini [^stuff-pasta], VeloutÃ© [^mother-sauce], and tagliatelle [^shape]â€”this is my form of therapy.
- I'm conscious about what I eat and try to substitute for organic ingredients when possible.
- I do follow a carnivore diet myself, but I'm happy to cook anything.
- I learned how to [[uses#cookware.|cook]] through books (Alice Waters and Thomas Keller's), observing chef [^stage] friends, and my mom.

</section>

[^mother-sauce]: Considered one of the "mother sauces" by legendary chef Auguste Escoffier

[^stuff-pasta]: rotation of fillings includes ricotta-based, mushroom, and meat-based. I try to make this at least once a month, depending on how busy life gets.

[^shape]:
    The pasta I make varies in shape, but it's always uovo pastaâ€”egg-based pasta made with a mix of 00-flour and semolina flour. I usually go for 80-20, but you can go without semolina. Note that semolina is based on durum wheat, so for folks that got allergy, I tend to exclude semolina.

    I hit the farmers' market every Sunday morning to get the freshest eggs possible. Ideally, the yolks should be super orange (I know this is hard to find in Ontario), but slightly yellow yolks work fine too.

    For trickier shapes like buccatini, I use the stand mixer to roll and cut the dough. Otherwise, I always roll by hand. Here's a recipe I've found that works well for four servings:

    - $\frac{3}{2}$ cups of flour | 227 grams (mixed at ratio mentioned above)
    - 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
    - 3 yolks + 1 whole eggs
    - distilled water (or any sort of water that has pH <= 7) to smooth the dough.

    You can use a food processor to mix the dough (this is the most efficient way to do this, if you are short in time). However, I prefer the traditional way, which is making a well, and develop the gluten by hand.

[^stage]: I want to stage at a restaurant nearby, but having trouble to find a gig to do so.

vinyl/[[movies|movies]]

- I collect [[mixed#vinyl]] and produced throwaway tunes in my free time.
  ![[posts/images/2023-flac-1.mp3]]
- Music is a huge part of my lifeâ€”I honestly wouldn't be able to function without it.
- I prefer classical orchestra, a mix of blues and jazz, 80s rock, and I have a deep appreciation for house and garage culture.
  - Rach 3, Rhapsody on Paganini
- A bit of a cinemaphile

design

- I [[/|designed this site you're on]], for example
  - I hate building websites, but I can't stand a badly designed one.

## compatibility.

```quotes
I would say that free will is nothing but our conscious experience of deciding what to do, which I know I am experiencing as I write this review, and this experience is not invalidated by the reflection that physical laws made it inevitable that I would want to make these decisions. -- Steven Weinberg
```

<section data-compat>

possible deal-breakers

1. Historically speaking, my relationship has been, _complicated_ [^poly]. I found that my work schedule fits well with that style of romantic attachment, and I'm definitely not the jealous type. Though my previous partner and I ended on a sour note, I'm more than happy with the growth.
2. I don't want kids, _yet_, at least for the next five years.
   - We are young still, many things yet to be explored.
   - That said, I'd make it work for the _right_ person.
3. I care deeply about my friends, and I believe that as partners, we don't have to do everything together. I definitely want to spend the majority of my time with you, but I'll need "boys" time.
4. Most of my friends are female. I have very clear boundaries that I **never cross** with friends, but I want all my female friendshipsâ€”especially with N, C, Siâ€”to remain strong.
5. I currently live in Toronto, Canada. I'm open to long-distance (but prefer not to) if there's a good chance we'd end up in the same city, assuming everything goes well! San Francisco, Berkeley, San Jose, New York, and Boston are all possibilities.
   - I do plan to move back to the US in the future, in the next 5-7 years.

</section>

[^poly]: I believe partners should provide certain functions to each others, and being in relationships shouldn't be a constraint that prevent you from exploring something different and _new_. Hence, my past relationships have mostly been polyamorous. However, I'm open to monogamy. Note that if for monogamy, I will see it as a 100% commitment, and won't take infidelity lightly.

<section data-compat>

what i'm offering in a relationship

1. I'm cautiously optimistic, sometimes a bit self-deprecating.
2. My attachment style has always been ["securely attached"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory#Attachment_styles_in_adults:~:text=%5B116%5D-,Securely%20attached,-%5Bedit%5D), though I found that my previous partner was ["anxious-preoccupied"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory#Attachment_styles_in_adults:~:text=%5B118%5D-,Anxious%2Dpreoccupied,-%5Bedit%5D), which is a bit easier to give them "word of affirmation". I'm a caregiver at heart, so I definitely want to look after you.
3. I will cook for you. You don't have to come into the kitchen, but you're more than welcome to join.
4. My [love languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Love_Languages) are physical touch, gifts, and quality time. I think of a life _partner_ as someone you're mutually supportive of and committed toâ€”someone you're building something together with.
5. I will get you flowers.
6. I will write letters to you.

</section>

<section data-compat>

what i'm looking for in a partner

By all means, this is _not all checkbox that I'm looking for_, but good signals for a good relationship:

1. driven, high empathy, emotional maturity
2. witty / sharp
3. we can meanders about nothing for hours
4. confidence or being in stem is _sooooooo attractive to me_
5. non-avoidance attachment style
6. spontaneous and adventurous soul
7. si vous parlez franÃ§ais, fantastique je t'aime
8. open-minded, with a bit of je ne sais quoi, fabuleuse

</section>

<section data-compat>

if this sounds like _you_

I'd love to:

1. take you out on a picnic date where we can rent a vhs and eat strawberry, or
2. we can go bouldering, grab food, then spend the night watching "paris, texas", or
3. rent a cabin near lake simcoe, and enjoy the nature.
