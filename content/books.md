## to read.

### [[tags/philosophy|philosophy]] and psychology

_reason: I have a few collections of books whose authors are somewhat related [^related-authors]._

[^related-authors]: For example, [[thoughts/Freud|Freud]] and Jung are not necessarily philosophers, but their work often sparks philosophical debates regarding to human psyche and social interactions.
