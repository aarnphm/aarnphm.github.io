title: Building antilibrary
---

A (mostly) up-to-date book lists that I read, wanting, am reading, or finished reading.

> In essence, an [antilibrary](https://nesslabs.com/antilibrary) is a collection of unread books. It represents an ode to self that reminds you about topics that one wants to explore.
