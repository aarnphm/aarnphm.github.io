- rsh: new shell language written with Rust-like syntax
  - I get fed up with bash
  - Should be cloud-first?
  - Nix inspiration for caching and package management?
- [[thoughts/Rust|Rust]] key-value store
  - Think of it as MongoDB but has Redis capability
- Dockerfile for LLM
  - [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama)'s Modelfile.
  - Dockerfile frontend, [[thoughts/BuildKit]], [[thoughts/OCI|OCI]]-compliant frontend.
  - Stay away from Docker ðŸ˜„
- newgit
  - pain:
    - each of the nodes are essentially a miniature filesystem (tree + blob), which is cheap, but the object models knows almost nothing about operations. So move/rename/copy is not supported. Rename are heuristic mostly (-M). Good enough for most cases.
    - Actually it doesnâ€™t track rename, which annoys tf out of me. The only do it during diff/merge via similarity lol. Mercurial actually does support rename lol.
    - Merge is actually not associative/commutative whatsoever. Merge are just a mess. <- can be a CRDT here.
    - contents are essentially opaque blobs. Git only merges line, but we have AST parsers nowadays. So merge can be made into AST parse.
    - scaling is a fucking pain, patches are annoying. packfiles, bitmaps, bisect is are all circumventions for scaling up, but working on monorepo without this is essentially hell. So for folks who donâ€™t know how to use these effectively, GG go next
    - out-of-band blob like LFS are not scallable, partial clone reduces history transfers. Most of these solutions are just bands to support companies like Google (for historical reasons)
    - SHA-1 is outdated, fwiw there are path for SHA-256 to support, but they couples the SHA-1 identity quite tight.
    - haha donâ€™t even get me started with POSIX.
  - stuff to do:
    - Merkle-CRDT: content-addressable storage (like docker layers) with history DAG:
      - but merges a lattice over well-typed objects so concurrent edits converges
      - patches/changes are first class
      - commits are views
    - Content stores: DAG-CBOR or any type of canonical encoding is fine (BLAKE3 and zstd for compression
    - typed nodes:
      - observed-remove set (OR-set) of entries {name -> fileId} with move/rename as CRDT ops
      - delete are GG, merge are add-wins/remove-wins via policy
      - file are plain blob with diff3 as fallback, or a sequence CRDT for files to opt-in for collaborative semantic diff
      - for code, just use something like ast-grep or any auxillary ast index for structural merges
      - patches/changes are first-class objectives, maybe something like https://pijul.org/manual/theory.html
      - commits are more of a manifest/metadata

- disappearing text
