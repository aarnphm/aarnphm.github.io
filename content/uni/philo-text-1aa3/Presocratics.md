### Anaximander

> material cause and first element of things was the unbounded _aperion_

- earth is cylindrical form, that its depth is as a third part of its breath
- begetting hot and cold was separated off from the eternal at the origin of the world.

  The heavenly bodies are wheels of fire separated off from the fire which encircles the world, enclosed with air

  Living creatures arose from the moist element as it was evaporated by the sun. Man was like another animal, namely, a fish, in the beginning.

often associated with _aperion_ and _infinite_ as the fundamental of the universe

> Human arose from inside of the fish, and become capable of protecting themselves.

### Democritus

Atomism

Atomic hypothesis -> nature is Atoms and Void

- Nature is body and void, nothing else, not purpose or design
- Soul is the body
  System of the atom
  Atoms of different sizes and shape
  Coalesce and accumulate -> soul
  > Soul is the matter of the finest, smallest, matter, coherently all part of the organism
- Primary and secondary qualities
  - Primary: atoms are size, shape, and height
  - Secondary: molecular combinations include hot/cold, moist/dry

> Sweet exists by convention, bitter by convention, colour by convention.

Division comes to a stop when atom -> Atom is the least divisible factor

Absolute stopping point for destruction -> rearrangement of these atoms are indispensable

If there are gods -> they have to have body -> no atom is immortal
-> Gods are immortal.

For Greek, Gods are human are indifferent.
