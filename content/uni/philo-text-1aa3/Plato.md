# Apology

- Defence against charges against them
- Promote study under the earth and sky
- Corrupt youth use of Athens -> promote new gods (last for 1 day)

Poisons

- Contrary to the charges -> never takes money for instruction
	- Available to anyone without any fees -> Socrates didn't teach, just talk in public
	- Converse with knowledgable -> these ppl never shares their wisdom
	- Socrates go after people?
		- Need to embarrass them?
		- Oracle at Delphi -> Anyone wiser than Socrates?
			- No one is wiser than Socrates
		- Socrates doesn't feel wise?
			- Enquire about what *wisdom* is?
		- Enquire knowledgable -> bored
		- Enquire poets -> Wisdom doesn't come from poets (poets inspired from wisdom of the god)
		- Enquire technicians -> not the right source of knowledge for wisdom
			- Craftman = incapable of explain why he does what he does -> verbal explanation is irrelevant

> Wisdom can be used both for good and bad

	Wisdom is a penetrate into the goods, not the bad

Oracle at Delphi -> reputation for enigma (ironic, play with words)

Oracle could mock humanity (`No one is wiser than Socrates`)
- He is the wisest
- No one is wise (Socrates is as wise, and he knows he is not wise -> no hope)
- He is the wisest because he knows he is not wisest

> He does not know anything **fine** and **good**

Socrates posses no expertise in making goodness


> Socrates: Mission to relentless for people to confront them for their ignorance, takes care of your soul

Convicted by the stupidity of them all

### Dialog

*Dikasts* -> Arguments:
- Behaviour is not subversive, contrary to their beliefs, and doesn't harm the city
- Actions are sanctified by the gods -> You don't understand anything
- Follow his conscience rather than follow their democracy
- Contempt towards democracy, Mockery
- Democracy is a childish form of government

> My trial will be equivalent to a doctor being prosecuted by a pastry-cook before a jury of children

#### Context of the trial
- Athens -> democracy from 508 to 322 BCE
- Peloponnesian War -> Sparta defats Athens
- Alkibiades: friend of Socrates
	- Dissolute
	- Conflicted about this character
		- Admire his charm, leadership quality
		- Poty, aristocratic -> fear from his ambition
		- Fear from friends of Alkibiades
		- His family is from Spartan
		- Charges for treason -> Sentenced to death -> Resurface in Spartan -> democracy is corrupted
	- Assassination attempted
	- Return to Athens as a hero
	- 404 -> Athens accepted terms to surrender to Spartan
	- Assassinated while traveling

-> probable enemy of Democracy (Socrates) -> look for someone to blame
- Because he was a friend of Alkibiades -> find scapegoat for a failing democracy

Among philoshophers, poets to be contempted with Athens democracy:
- Masses are childish, fickle, easily misled
- Unnatural, tyranny of the weak over the strong
- Confuses freedom with lack of restraint, favors flatterers
- Inefficient

> Government should be efficient -> chose the best person to govern

Socratic rules would not be Aristocrat, rather experts, masters acquired by rulership.
Philosophical rulers ->
- Crucial to make them wise and knowledgable
- Establish education -> reason well and follow reasons

[[Nietzsche]] -> problems with Socrates
- Reasoned and consciously sound
- Un-examined mind is not worth living?

> What makes wisdom so good?

## Socratic Idea of Good
> Something is good when it contributes to the full flourishing of a human being in all our powers and faculties for the natural duration of life.

Know how to use all things in a way it tends good

What is not good might not be wise?

-> really cares about Athens, wisdom, then why not participate and join in debates?
- Afraid participating in this democracy?
	- Heard this voice -> never tells him what to do, speak against things from what he is considering doing
	- Turned him away from doing wrong things
	- Too honest to survive if occupied with justice
	- Can't serve justice with service
	- Man whose serve justice must live a private not public life

-> Never does the voice tells him to defence himself
-> Thought about fleeing -> Voice told him not to
-> What happens after trial may be not a bad thing -> Death is not a bad thing

-> Socrates is unmoved after receiving death
> You too must be a good hope in place of death. A good man cannot be harmed

What you think to harm me harms you a lot more

He knows there is a life after death ?
