## chaotic system.



## as definition.

> Chaos, in a general sense, refers to a state of disorder, unpredictability, and lack of structure.

## as a concept.

What [[dump/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] would probably say:

- Chaos is the essence of existence.
  - The world is not governed by fixed rules and predetermined order
  - "eternal recurrence" - a litmus test for an individual's capacity to affirm life <-
- The Ãœbermensch must find his footing, create his own values and embrace such chaos.

[[dump/university/philo-1aa3/John Stuart Mill|Utilitarianism]] relations to chaos?
