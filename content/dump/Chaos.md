> Chaos: a lossiness [collection](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/self-organizing-ideas) of one's [[dump/Will|will]] to life.

The etymology of chaos traces back to the Greek word χάος (khaos), meaning which means abyss, that which gapes wide open, that which is vast and [empty](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/chaos-meaning-and-history)

## as system.

We can often see [[dump/Entropy|entropy]] as a consequence of chaos. These are often linked, yet distinct concepts.

The loss of order induces unpredictability within deterministic systems, or such systems are _sensitive dependent_ on initial condition. Whereas entropy deals with property of how one system can be arranged.

We can observe this through Lorenz attractor

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= \sigma(y - x), \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= x(\rho - z) - y, \\
\frac{dz}{dt} &= xy - \beta z.
\end{align*}
$$

What [[dump/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] would imply:

> Alas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow of his longing beyond man—and the string of his bow will have unlearned to whizz!

> I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.

_extracted from Z V, Death of The God_

Chaos is the essence of one existence. Such that the world is not governed by fixed rules and predetermined order. Nietzsche rejects [[dump/Transcendentals|transcendentals chaos]], such construct reality beyond sensory understanding. These truths are [[dump/Philosophy and Nietzsche#Prejudices of Philosophers|philosophers' prejudices]] that deny one's will to [[dump/Will#as power.|power]], such that all truth are just one's perception and experience.

- "eternal recurrence" - a litmus test for an individual's capacity to affirm life <- Actively mentioned throughout [[dump/Philosophy and Nietzsche#Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Thus Spoke Zarathustra]].
  - implies the possibility of composite [[dump/papers/Nietzsche the Kantian Self and Eternal Recurrence.pdf|self]], that the individual remains the same for eternity of life.
  - allows chaos to remain the force of life, and will to power to be a configuration of chaos.
    > The self, for Nietzsche, is not just a radically unstable postmodern self.  It is such a self, but it is not simply such a self.  It also has a stability, sameness, and unity that goes far beyond anything Kant ever imagined in his wildest dreams

The Übermensch must find his footing, create his own values through labyrinth of life. Chaos is important for the creation of anything that is truly new and valuable.

What [[dump/university/philo-1aa3/John Stuart Mill|Mill]] would imply:


## as information.

> [[dump/monetary|Money]] is an information system for labor allocation.

Money doesn't have any power intrinsically in itself. You can't simply throw more money into a system, as well as chaos into a system.

Chaos is also an information system for growth. It manifests itself through different decisions. From chaos one can derive order through the learning of chaos.
