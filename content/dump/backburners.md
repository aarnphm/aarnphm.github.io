- A new shell language with Rust-like syntax (rsh)
  - I get fed up with bash
  - Should be cloud-first?
  - Nix inspiration for caching and package management?
- [[dump/Rust|Rust]] key-value store
  - Think of it as MongoDB but has Redis capability
- Simplified Dockerfile
  - Since dockerfile frontend are just using [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit), maybe it can just be an OCI-compliant frontend.
  - Stay away from Docker ðŸ˜„
  - frontend can be in TOML, YAML
- bazil: A [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) for the unversed
  - Bazel is hard to get started with
