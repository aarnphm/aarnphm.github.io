- A shell language written in [[Rust]]

  - Cloud native
  - easy to read
  - features
    - pattern matching: `match r'![_*].' {...}`
    - functional: `fn a = (s, n) { ... }`

- [[Rust]] key-value store
  - Think of it as MongoDB but has Redis capability
- Dockerfile but easier to use

  - frontend can be in TOML, YAML
- bazil: A [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) for the unversed
  - Bazel is hard to get started with
