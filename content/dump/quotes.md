### On Thinking.

Our capacity to deal with [[dump/Language|language]] is a complex, genetically-determined part of our biological endowment. It's a product of evolution, part of our nature. -- Noam Chomsky

The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions â€” that the renunciation of false opinions would be [a renunciation of life]. -- [[dump/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche]]

### On Drive.

I just wondered how things were put together. -- Claude Shannon
