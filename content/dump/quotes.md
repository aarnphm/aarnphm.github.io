### On perspectives.

Our capacity to deal with [[dump/Language|language]] is a complex, genetically-determined part of our biological endowment. It's a product of evolution, part of our nature. -- Noam Chomsky

The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions — that the renunciation of false opinions would be [a renunciation of life]. -- [[dump/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche]]

I always feel happy, you know why? Because I don’t expect anything from anyone. Expectations always hurt. Life is short. So love your life. Be Happy. & Keep smiling. Just live for yourself & before you speak, listen. Before you write, think. Before you spend, earn. Before you pray, forgive. Before you hurt, feel. Before you hate, love. Before you quit, try. Before you die, live. -- William Shakespeare

### On drive.

Life can be much broader when you discover one simple fact...that everything around you was made up by people no smarter than you. ... Once you learn that, [you'll never be the same again.] -- Steve Jobs

I just wondered how things were put together. -- Claude Shannon

Never stop learning. Assume nothing, question everything. Teach others what you know. Analyze objectively -- Richard Feynman
