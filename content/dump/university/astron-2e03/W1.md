## Obj.

- content of solar system and orbital properties
- Compare properties of Solar System to known exoplanetary
- _six_ techniques for exoplanet detection & limitation.

## How people learn?

> Student enter the classroom with preconceptions about how the world works. If their _initial understanding is not fully engaged, they may fail to grasp new concepts_

_develop competence_
1. foundation knowledge
2. interrelationships among facts and concepts
3. retrieval and application.

## Solar system


Sun -> terrestrial planets -> asteroid belt -> Jovian (gas giants) ~ Ice giant planets -> Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) (Dwarf planets -> Kuiper belt -> Oort cloud)


> `1 au` (astronomical unit): average distance between Earth and Sun

> Planetary orbits are (nearly) _co-planar_
- Dispersion in mutual inclinations: $\Delta{i} \approx 2\text{ deg}$
- pPluto and many other TNOs are _more highly inclinded_

Consequence of **Protoplanetary disks**
_from Alma telescope_
- radio images of _warm dust continuum_ ($\leq 10^6\text{ Myrs}$)
- Disk sizes $\approx 100\text{ au}$
- Variety of morphologies

> [!question]
> Concentric gaps opened by _protoplanets_?

- Due to active construction of _two protoplanets?_

> [!question]
> What other _dynamical properties_ do you expect for planets formed from a disk?


- **Keplerian Motion**: Planets formed from a disk are expected to exhibit Keplerian motion -> direct consequence rather than properties 

### Regular vs. Irregular Satellites (aka, moons)

| Regular Satellites | Irregular |
| ---- | ---- |
| Resemble mini planetary systems | Irregular orbits |
| prograde, nearly circular orbits, low mutual inclinations, e.g: 4 Galilean moons of Jupyter | prograde or retrograde orbits, highly elliptical and highly inclined |
|  |  |

> Most exoplanetary systems are compact

Kepler-11 System

### Transit

- Time-resolved photometry (i.e. stellar brightness) = “light curve” 
Can measure: 
- Orbital period 
- Orbital inclination 
	- Has to be edged-on
	- **relative to telescope**, not to the _star_
	- Reference is line-of-sight to exoplanetary system.
- Planet radius
