Open-loop versus closed-loop

Transient and steady-state response

Stability

- Total response = Natural response + Forced response
  - Natural response (homogeneous solution): evolution of system due to initial conditions
  - Forced response (particular solution): evolution of system due to input

Control objects:
- Stabilize the system
- Produce the desired transient response
- Decrease/eliminate steady-state error
- Make system "robust" to withstand disturbances and variations in parameters
- Achieve optimal performance
