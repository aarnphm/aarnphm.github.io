Reflecting on the recent work with the Mosaic school portal project, the primary experience that stands out to me was the collaborative effort in generating user requirements from our study. We conducted interviews and surveys, collected and analyzed data, and eventually synthesized this into actionable requirements. This process was intensive and required meticulous attention to detail and close communication with my team.

The experience aligns closely with the course's emphasis on human-centered design (HCD) and user-centered design (UCD), particularly the stages of empathizing with users and defining their needs. It resonated with me on a personal level as it was reminiscent of my co-op term in San Francisco. There, I encountered similar challenges in understanding user requirements for deploying machine learning models. The current project served as a reinforcement of those lessons, underscoring the importance of direct user engagement to inform design decisions.

This work also taps into my personal values of collaboration, empathy, and continuous improvement. The hands-on engagement with users and data strengthens my belief in the significance of building solutions that truly address user needs. It was a practical application of the theory, confirming my view on the necessity of grounding design in actual user experience rather than assumptions.

While the experience confirmed some of my views, it also challenged me to reconsider my approach to user studies. Previously, I may have placed too much emphasis on quantitative data, but this experience highlighted the richness of qualitative insights, prompting me to value a more balanced approach.

From this experience, I conclude that effective user study is both an art and a science, requiring a blend of structured analysis and intuitive understanding. Moving forward, I will ensure to incorporate a more holistic view of user feedback in my work. I'll continue to advocate for user involvement throughout the project lifecycle, ensuring that their voices are not only heard but are influential in the design process.

For the ongoing project, I will continue to engage closely with my team, ensuring that our communication channels remain open and active, allowing for seamless integration of our individual components. For the broader scope of HCD/UCD practice beyond this course, I will take with me the lesson of valuing both qualitative and quantitative data, and the importance of user empathy in informing design decisions, which will undoubtedly influence my future work in this field.
