### The complexity of modern devices

> What is a good design?
>
> - Discoverability
>   - possible to figure out what actions are possible
>   - where and how to perform them
> - Understanding
>   - What does it mean?
>   - How is it supposed to be used

| Industrial    | form & material               | function, value, appearance of the product & system                            | Users & manufacturer |
| Interaction   | understandability & usability | understanding in technology interaction, upon psychology, design, art          | users                |
| Experience    | emotional impact              | designing products focused placed on quality and enjoyment of total experience | Users                |

?: What are the deficiency in human-machine interaction?

- limitation of today-technology
- self-imposed restriction such as: cost
- lack of understanding of the design principles

> Human Centred Design is an approach that puts human needs, capabilities, and behaviour first, then design to accommodate those needs, capabilities and machine behaviour.

| Human-centred design                                                     | Process that ensures design match needs and capabilities of the people for whom they are intended |

### Fundamental principles of Interaction

#### Experience

- how fondly people remember their interaction
- discoverability
  - affordances
  - signifiers
  - contraints
  - mappings
  - feedback
  - conceptual model of the system
