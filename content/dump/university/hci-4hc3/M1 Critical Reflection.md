My experience with my teammates has been consistently positive. They have shown professionalism and responsiveness, providing constructive feedback and actively contributing their ideas. My previous 12-month co-op at a machine learning (ML) infrastructure startup, where I collaborated with a globally distributed team, emphasized the critical role of collaborative and agile development workflows in project success. As a result, the iterative process for idea generation came naturally to us when brainstorming concepts, ultimately leading us to choose the improvement of Mosaic as our project focus.

Holding onto my prior experience working on a Software as a Service (SAAS) product for deploying ML models, particularly my involvement in designing the general user experience of the platform, I recognized the importance of creating low-fidelity prototypes and iterating quickly to deliver an MVP to the users. With this in mind, I actively encouraged and supported our team in generating ideas and provided continuous feedback to ensure that our work aligned with the project's scope.

I've consistently demonstrated effective communication and articulation, readily identifying shortcomings in terms of features and accessibility in the current Mosaic solution. As a lead UX/UI designer for this project, I will continue to emphasize these aspects, striving to maintain the same level of clarity and diligence in my contributions to the team.
