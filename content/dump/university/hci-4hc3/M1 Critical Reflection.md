My experience with my teammates has been consistently positive. They have shown professionalism and responsiveness, providing constructive feedback and actively contributing their ideas. My previous 12-month co-op at a machine learning (ML) infrastructure startup, where I collaborated with a globally distributed team, emphasized the critical role of collaborative and agile development workflows in project success. As a result, the iterative process for idea generation came naturally to us when brainstorming concepts, ultimately leading us to choose the improvement of Mosaic as our project focus.

Holding onto my prior experience working on a Software as a Service (SAAS) product for deploying ML models, particularly my involvement in designing the general user experience of the platform, I recognized the importance of creating low-fidelity prototypes and iterating quickly to deliver an MVP to the users. With this in mind, I actively encouraged and supported our team in generating ideas and provided continuous feedback to ensure that our work aligned with the project's scope.

I've consistently demonstrated effective communication and articulation, readily identifying shortcomings in terms of features and accessibility in the current Mosaic solution. As a lead UX/UI designer for this project, I will continue to emphasize these aspects, striving to maintain the same level of clarity and diligence in my contributions to the team.

My experience with my teammates has been very positive. For this milestone, it involves a lot of coordination, among every team members for doing different components of the milestone. I was in charge of generating requirements from the users study and the reflected persona. This is deemed to be valuable for the team as it provides a clear direction for us to work on for the following milestones. Since my component depends heavily on the previous two parts, I was assisting my teammates on analysing the data from their corresponding user study. This is closely to what I did during my co-op in SF where I got to also conduct a user study to figure out the pain points for enterprise users trying to deploying machine learning models to production.
