## Problem 1

> [!question] P1.1
>
> Consider an initially-empty stack $S$ and the following sequence of operations:
> ```plaintext
> PUSH(S, 3), POP(S), PUSH(S, 17), PUSH(S, 5), PUSH(S, 15), POP(S), POP(S), POP(S)
> ```
> Illustrate the result of each operation (clearly indicate the content of the stack after the operation and, in case of a `POP`, the returned value by the operation

_Solution_

Stack $S$ is initially empty, or $S = \emptyset$

The sequence of operations is as follows:

1. `PUSH(S, 3)`: $S = \lbrace 3 \rbrace$

2. `POP(S)`: $S = \emptyset$, returned value is $3$

3. `PUSH(S, 17)`: $S = \lbrace 17 \rbrace$

4. `PUSH(S, 5)`: $S = \lbrace 17, 5 \rbrace$

5. `PUSH(S, 15)`: $S = \lbrace 17, 5, 15 \rbrace$

6. `POP(S)`: $S = \lbrace 17, 5 \rbrace$, returned value is $15$

7. `POP(S)`: $S = \lbrace 17 \rbrace$, returned value is $5$

8. `POP(S)`: $S = \emptyset$, returned value is $17$

> Consider an initially-empty queue $Q$ and the following sequence of operations:
> ```plaintext
> ENQUEUE(Q, 3), DEQUEUE(Q), ENQUEUE(Q, 17), ENQUEUE(Q, 5), ENQUEUE(Q, 15), DEQUEUE(Q), DEQUEUE(Q), DEQUEUE(Q)
> ```
> Illustrate the result of each operation (clearly indicate the content of the queue after the operation and, in case of a `DEQUEUE`, the returned value by the operation

_Solution_

Queue $Q$ is initially empty, or $Q = \emptyset$

The sequence of operations is as follows:

1. `ENQUEUE(Q, 3)`: $Q = \lbrace 3 \rbrace$

2. `DEQUEUE(Q)`: $Q = \emptyset$, returned value is $3$

3. `ENQUEUE(Q, 17)`: $Q = \lbrace 17 \rbrace$

4. `ENQUEUE(Q, 5)`: $Q = \lbrace 17, 5 \rbrace$

5. `ENQUEUE(Q, 15)`: $Q = \lbrace 17, 5, 15 \rbrace$

6. `DEQUEUE(Q)`: $Q = \lbrace 5, 15 \rbrace$, returned value is $17$

7. `DEQUEUE(Q)`: $Q = \lbrace 15 \rbrace$, returned value is $5$

8. `DEQUEUE(Q)`: $Q = \emptyset$, returned value is $15$

> Assume we have a stack implementation `MyDynArrayStack` using dynamic arrays: the implementation supports `N` push operations with an amortized runtime complexity of $\Theta(1)$ per operation, and the implementation supports `POP`, `EMPTY`, and `SIZE` operations with runtime time complexity of $\Theta(1)$
>
> Provide a _queue_ implementation that uses `MyDynArrayStack` and supports any valid sequence of `N` `ENQUEUE` and `DEQUEUE` operations with an amortized runtime complexity of $\Theta(1)$ per operation. Explain why your implementation has the stated amortized runtime complexity for `ENQUEUE` and `DEQUEUE` operations.

_Solution_

Queue implementation `MyDynArrayQueue` using two `MyDynArrayStack`, `sIn` and `sOut`:
```pseudo
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Queue}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE $sIn := \text{MyDynArrayStack()}$
\STATE $sOut := \text{MyDynArrayStack()}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```
```pseudo
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{ENQUEUE(x)}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE $sIn.\text{PUSH}(x)$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```
```pseudo
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{DEQUEUE()}
\begin{algorithmic}
\IF{$sOut.\text{EMPTY}()$}
    \WHILE{$\neg sIn.\text{EMPTY}()$}
        \STATE $sOut.\text{PUSH}(sIn.\text{POP}())$
    \ENDWHILE
\ENDIF
\RETURN $sOut.\text{POP}()$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```
where `sIn` is used to store elements, and `sOut` is used to store elements in reverse order.

Amortized runtime complexity explanation:

1. `ENQUEUE`
>
> - `PUSH` to `sIn` has an amortized runtime complexity of $\Theta(1)$ per operation, as stated in the problem.

2. `DEQUEUE`
>
> - When `sOut` is empty, the transfer of element from `sIn` to `sOut` has a runtime complexity of $\Theta(N)$ with worst case.
>
> - However, the item was moved once per enqueue-dequeue cycle, so the total time spent is proportional to $N$, thus making amortized runtime complexity of $\Theta(1)$ per operation.

## Problem 2

Consider the relations courses(`prog`, `code`, `name`) (that models courses named name and identified by the program `prog` the course is part of, e.g., SFWRENG, and the course code code, e.g., `2C03`) and `enrolled(prog, code, sid)` (that models students with identifier `sid` enrolling for a course identified by program `prog` and course code `code`).

We want to compute the list of all pairs (`sid`, `name`) in which `sid` is a student identifier $s$ and name is the name of a course the student with identifier $s$ is enrolled in. To compute this list, we developed the following two nested-loop algorithms:

```pseudo
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{CEJOIN(courses, enrolled)}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE $output := \emptyset$.
\FOR{$(p_c, c_c, n_c) \in \text{courses}$}
    \FOR{$(p_e, c_e, s_e) \in \text{enrolled}$}
        \IF{$p_c = p_e \textbf{ and } c_c = c_e$}
            \STATE add $(s_e, n_c)$ to $output$.
        \ENDIF
    \ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

```pseudo
\begin{algorithm}
\caption{ECJOIN(courses, enrolled)}
\begin{algorithmic}
\STATE $output := \emptyset$.
\FOR{$(p_e, c_e, s_e) \in \text{enrolled}$}
    \FOR{$(p_c, c_c, n_c) \in \text{courses}$}
        \IF{$p_c = p_e \textbf{ and } c_c = c_e$}
            \STATE add $(s_e, n_c)$ to $output$.
        \ENDIF
    \ENDFOR
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}
```

Assume we have significantly more students enrolled for courses than courses (`|enrolled| > |courses|`).

> Assume we are running algorithm `CEJOIN` and `ECJOIN` on a computer $\mathbb{C}$ where _every_ instruction takes _exactly the same_ amount of time to execute. Argue why `CEJOIN` must be faster than `ECJOIN` when running on computer $\mathbb{C}$?

_Solution_

Given  $|enrolled| > |courses|$, the difference between the two lies in the number of iterations of the inner loop.

The outer loop table will only be scanned once, and the inner loop will be scanned for each iteration of the outer loop in the nested-loop algorithm:

- `CEJOIN` will iterate over `enrolled` once, and `courses` over each iteration. Since `|enrolled| > |courses|`, `CEJOIN`'s inner loop will result in fewer iteration.
- `ECJOIN` will iterate over `courses` once, and `enrolled` over each iteration. Since `|enrolled| > |courses|`, `ECJOIN`'s inner loop will means more iterations, comparing to `CEJOIN`.

Thus, we can conclude that `CEJOIN` must be faster than `ECJOIN` when running on computer $\mathbb{C$.

> Implementation of `CEJOIN` and `ECJOIN` in [[dump/university/sfwr-2c03/a2/impl_22.cpp|impl_22.cpp]]  shows that `ECJOIN` is actually faster than `CEJOIN`. Explain why this is the case in a real-world system.

Given the processor is using

> Write an algorithm that efficiently computes the same result as `CEJOIN` and `ECJOIN` in all-case $\Theta(|enrolled| \log_2{(|courses|)})$. In the design of your algorithm, you may require that either enrolled or courses is ordered. Argue why your algorithm is correct and why it has the runtime complexity we specified.
