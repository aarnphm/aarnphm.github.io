[[dump/university/philo-1aa3/Presocratics|Pre-Socratic]] lives by materialism

refers to Ionian:

> keen on _nature_ science. Why it comes to be, why exists?

Dissatisfied with nature science

Apolo's oracle at Delphi: `Know yourself`

He knows nothing about superior things and right way to live

He is not wise

> Cannot be wise about nature, without wise of ourself for how we live and love

Use the knowledge well

### Wisdom

> Begins in self-understanding

What is the way we ought to live?

Philo-sophia
love-wisdom != not being wise

Can only love what we lack

> Precisely not to be wise

Philosophers vs. Fool: Philosophers knows hes not wise, whereas a fool doesn't

Longs for wisdom => only god is wise
complete wisdom are not for human

Learn from Pythagorias

Soul is not human life, paradoxical of life

Hermenedies: Pythagorian cares for the soul (rational, pursue for rational)

Neither gods nor beast
Spiritual beings operate between gods and beast

- not posses wisdom but can have the ability to pursue such wisdom

Socrates

What is X?

- True of all case
- Reason why something is an X

ex: Logos what gods love some, not others

> Platonic Idea (Form)
> The idea of X is the form all particular Xs share, and which cause them to be X.

Plato -> Idea for all Socrates asks
-> More than materialism
-> from Socratic or Platonic is wrong - Idea is not material, not body in space or time - Ordinary experience

Charges for Athenian trials?

Animosity wrt to his way of being?
