Theology, acquainted with Greek philosophy

_Twilight of the Idols, 1889_

# Problem of Socrates.

**Decadent: in decline, decay. "Doing a bad thing carefully."**

> An unexamined life is not worth living. Only Knowledge alone makes life worth living

Importance things in life: goodness, happiness, depends on reasons, arguments
-> bizarre equations.
> Maybe something wrong with this? What drives Socrates from this demands with reasons and knowledge? What are the motives?

Hume: Common life

Plato: Turns away from appearance, material life to know the true being

Artist: playful presentation, loving life for the work 

Philosophers: Not joy, serious, engaged in serious business, striving to know the truth. Invent nothing, contemplate what is, what is true, "being qua being"

> One must be all means stretch out one's fingers and make the attempt to grasp this amazing finesse, that the value of life cannot be estimated. (269)

Life is not a closed books, but evolving still.

# God is Dead
_God of the philosophers_

Atheism

Denis Diderot: "It is ... very important not to mistake hemlock for parsley; but to believe or not to believe in god, is not important at all"

Nietzsche: "God is dead". Means optimism, faith in science, the redemptive power of knowledge is "dead", that is, unconvicing, hard to take seriously.

*Nihilism: The highest values are devaluing themselves*

How do we have duty on truth?

Doesn't need reasons to be atheism?

For N, believing god is passing into the past, and have no feature. Science has devitalise god.

So to die the superior value of truth. Value of Truth is problematic.

## From _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_

Contrast between Nobility and goodness
_noble spirits vs. good_
nobility > good
noble people: maintain nobility, might considered by other as setback
not become "a churl" (churlish, misanthropic, a hater of humanity)

## Morality as Anti-Nature

Critiques in Christianity,

- Anti-nature because anti-difference, when nature is all difference
- Anti-nature because it values people all the same, when in nature, by nature, we are amazingly different.

Security with "herd mentality"

Regards as sign of decline, docile (democracy, or [[dump/university/philo-1aa3/John Stuart Mill|John Stuart Mill]]'s instution)

> Obstacles that are good for us: Becomes who we are

Herd = human society
- like sheep: unhappy on our own. Watch each other carefully, follow into our line
- all herd: All animals all nervously watch each others

Peace is overrated, as defeats kind of challenges to grow for leaders

herd = security (survival values, of Europe at this time?)

Everything modern people thinks good is bad, things judges to be evil could turn out to be good in the future.
