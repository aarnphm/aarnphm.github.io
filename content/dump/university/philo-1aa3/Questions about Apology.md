	A voice turned Socrates away from politics. Wisely, as Socrates sees it. “Do you really imagine I could have survived all these years, if I had led a public life?” (42) You cannot serve both justice and the state. “He who will fight for the right, if he would live even for a brief space, must have a private station and not a public one”—that is, must lead a private, not a public life, if he is to survive. (41) 
	(a) Why does Socrates say this? What reasons can you find (whether in Apology or elsewhere) for his position? Summarize and explain in your own words. 
	(b) Is the idea one you find plausible or implausible? Explain why you take your view.
