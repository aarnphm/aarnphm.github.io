> A voice turned Socrates away from politics. Wisely, as Socrates sees it. “Do you really imagine I could have survived all these years, if I had led a public life?” (42) You cannot serve both justice and the state. “He who will fight for the right, if he would live even for a brief space, must have a private station and not a public one”—that is, must lead a private, not a public life, if he is to survive. (41)
> 1. Why does Socrates say this? What reasons can you find (whether in Apology or elsewhere) for his position? Summarise and explain in your own words. 
> 2. Is the idea one you find plausible or implausible? Explain why you take your view.

In Plato's Apology, Socrates delineates a distinct boundary between pursuing a life of justice and engaging in politics. He posits that a life devoted to righteousness is fundamentally at odds with the realm of political involvement (Apology, pp. 41-42). Through the Socratic dialogues of Socrates' own trials, Plato illustrates an examination of the moral and ethical foundations of the Athenians society and political system, underscored by Socrates' assertions, _"He who will fight for the right, if he would live even for a brief space, must have a private station and not a public one"_. Consequently, I find myself aligning with Socrates' perspective, asserting that leading a just life is an endeavour incompatible with holding political office.

Socrates ascribes his abstention of political engagement to a divine mandate ("a voice") directing him towards the pursuit of truth and virtue. At the onset of the trial, Socrates mentions a prophecy from the Oracle of Delphi, which declared that "no man [is] wiser" than Socrates. Spurred by this proclamation, Socrates engages with renowned for their wisdom through scrutiny and questioning, in an attempt to unravel the oracle's message. Yet, none could furnish satisfactory answers to his inquires, leading Socrates to a profound realisation that his true wisdom is rooted in recognising his own ignorance for knowing nothing (Apology 21a-23b). Socrates then embarks on a path of not only confronting others' ignorance for wisdom but also challenging Athenians through his teaching methods and enquiries, embodying a commitment to virtuous living (Apology, 23b-23d). This philosophy is further emphasised in his dialogue, where the statement "the unexamined life is not worth living" encapsulates his conviction and mission to lead a life rooted in truth and virtue.
