> A voice turned Socrates away from politics. Wisely, as Socrates sees it. “Do you really imagine I could have survived all these years, if I had led a public life?” (42) You cannot serve both justice and the state. “He who will fight for the right, if he would live even for a brief space, must have a private station and not a public one”—that is, must lead a private, not a public life, if he is to survive. (41)
> 1. Why does Socrates say this? What reasons can you find (whether in Apology or elsewhere) for his position? Summarise and explain in your own words. 
> 2. Is the idea one you find plausible or implausible? Explain why you take your view.

In Plato's Apology, Socrates delineates a distinct boundary between pursuing a life of justice and engaging in politics. He posits that a life devoted to righteousness is fundamentally at odds with the realm of political involvement (Apology, pp. 41-42). Through the Socratic dialogues of Socrates' own trials, Plato illustrates an examination of the moral and ethical foundations of the Athenians society and political system, underscored by Socrates' assertions, _"He who will fight for the right, if he would live even for a brief space, must have a private station and not a public one"_. Consequently, I find myself aligning with Socrates' perspective, asserting that leading a just life is an endeavour incompatible with holding political office.
