In Metaphysics, Aristotle writes:
	
	With a view to action, experience seems in no respect inferior to art [i.e., technical knowledge, e.g., engineering or medicine], and men of experience succeed even better than those who have theory without experience.... But yet we think that knowledge and understanding belong to art [i.e., technical mastery] rather than to experience, and we suppose artists [i.e., technicians, engineers] to be wiser than men of experience.... [W]e do not regard any of the senses as wisdom; yet surely these give the most authoritative knowledge of particulars. (132)

Here Aristotle says people with experience only do not have knowledge, do not understand, and are not wise, despite their ability to perform some tasks just as well as the professionals. He also says that people who rely on their senses may have authoritative knowledge of a sort, but not wisdom.  

Explain why you think Aristotle says these things, and what you understand him to mean by “knowledge” and by “wisdom”—what they are and why they are good. Strive to explain his points in your own terms, but use brief quotations to convince your reader that what you say really might be Aristotle’s idea. 

Finally, consider whether Aristotle’s ideas of knowledge and wisdom make sense in today’s world. Is there a different idea of knowledge or wisdom that better suits our situation and experience?

=> thesis on the questions (defend this through quotation)
different type of knowledge comparing to todays knowledge

pure theory ->

Account of knowledge and wisdom first
