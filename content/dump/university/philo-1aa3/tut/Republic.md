Allegory of the cave:
- See the shadow, but not the reflection of the real world
- Escape the prisoner -> convince them to go out and see what the real world is
- Talking about shadow (escape to identify real world now instead of the shadow)

### Republic pp. 124-125

Journey to Enlightenment?

Why most of them don't want to escape at the beginning?
Why only one of them to escape? -> fear of the unknown?

The form?
