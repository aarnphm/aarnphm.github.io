## Structure

Problem --> Thesis --> Structure

## Apology

- Outsider
  - Speaking in a language that is not the court

=> Knowing what good is enough for being good -> connect between wisdom and good action
=> To find the truth of what is good

> Athenians are harming themselves since Socrates is the only one who concerns the truth and what truly good is.

- "Ancient" / Recent accusation

  - Bad association with pre/post
  - Ancient:
    - Physicist -> enquire things in heaven and under the earth
    - Sophist: Use arguments that leads people away from the truth
      - Doesn't care about physics
      - "human/political virtue" --> People aren't as wise as they were

- Corrupts the youth
  - Hates democracy
  - not believe to the gods of the state
    => can't corrupt the youth: "No one does bad willingly. Corrupt person is more likely to harm people."
    => If you know that you are harming people -> you should come to me

> The unexamined life is not worth living

- Won't act as what is good and knowledge -> living a life of ignorance -> not a worth living life.

## Phaedo


- Pain and pleasure
- How suicide is wrong, facing death = good ?
- Philosophers desire death?
- What if the soul is not immortal?
  - Single vs composite

> All knowing is remembering <-- posteriori

pp 62,63:

- We know absolute equality
- Material equalities fall short of absolute equality

> To see inequality -> need to have knowledge of what absolute equality is, from experience

For Socrates -> ideas are not fluid
