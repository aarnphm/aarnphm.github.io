### Parmenides

### [[dump/university/philo-1aa3/Socrates|Socrates]]'s Idea of Good

- Something is good when it contributes to the flourish of human being
- Deny democracy
  - the masses are childish
  - unnatural, confuses freedom with lack of restraint
  - inefficient
  - bad at financial management

In [[dump/university/philo-1aa3/tut/Phaedo and Apology|Phaedo]]: `The body confuses the soul and does not allow it to acquire truth and wisdom`

_See [[dump/university/philo-1aa3/Plato#Apology|Apology]] for more information_

_Arguments for Survival_

Idea of all things come into being from their opposite
-> The have come from the death a soul _must_ exist despite being dead

- Understanding of perfection is independent of experience
- To have knowledge independently of experience -> soul must have exists b4 body
- Yes, soul will survive death, because soul that exists before birth must come from something dead
  - does not requires a living body to be a living soul

_Against soul scattering_

- can dissolve and scatter must be composite
  - composite changes, simple doesn't
  - Idea are simple
  - Understanding ideas is a pure power of mind
  - ideas are simple -> soul understand them are also simple
  - Soul does not consist of parts -> cannot change
- Soul brings life to a body -> death changes the body, but the souls live on.
- Idea of the Even cannot become odd, Hot cannot become cold, soul, makes a body alive cannot die.
