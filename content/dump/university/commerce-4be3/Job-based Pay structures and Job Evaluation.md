## Job Evaluation

> systematically determining the relative worth of jobs to create job structure within an organisation

> based on combination of job content, skills, values, organisation culture, external market


Decision:
- purpose
- single or multiple plans
- among alternative approaches
- involvement of relevant stakeholders
- evaluate usefulness

## establish purpose

aligned if
- supports organisation strategy
- supports workflow
- fair to employees
- motivates behaviour toward organisation objectives.

## single vs. multiple plans

- evaluation plans for different types of workflow
- number of job evaluation plans  _depends_ on how detailed it needs to be to make pay decisions

## choices of job evaluation

### simple ranking.

- order from highest to lowest based on relative values
- advantages: simple, fast, easy to understand and explain to employees; least expensive initially.
- disadvantages:
  - ranking criteria is poorly defined -> evaluations become biased
  - evaluators must be knowledgeable about all jobs
  - results are difficult to defend and costly solutions maybe be required.

| alternatives methods   | description    |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Alternation   | order descriptions alternately at each extreme, evaluators agree on which jobs are the most valuable  |
| Paired comparison | compare each job with every other job, number of comparisons = n(n-1)/2 |


### classification

- series of classes cover the range of jobs
- descriptions are labels which capture general nature of work

## point method

- assignment of numeric score
- procedure results in a relative ordering of jobs based on the number of points that each job "scores".

### 2. Determine Compensable Factors
- based on strategy and values of organisation

### 3. Scale the Factors
