> internal alignment: relationship among different jobs/skills/competencies within a single organisation, job structure

also known as internal equity

Structure needs
- support organisation strategy
- support workflow (process which good/services are delivered to the customer)
- motivates behaviour (line-of-sight)

> **career laddering/progression**

## Internal Pay Structure
> refers to the array of pay rates for different work or skills within a single organisation
- number of level
- pay differentials between levels
- criteria or bases used to determine those levels and differentials.
## differentials
> pay difference among levels
- requiring more skill/experience
- performed in unpleasant work conditions
- adds more value to the company
- motivations

## criteria
- content: work performed in a job
- value: worth of the work

## structure.

Job-based structure: work content - tasks, behaviours, responsibilities (engineering teams)

Person-based structure: skill, knowledge, competencies focus to employees (lawyer, clientele)

## impact.

### external factors
- economic pressures: inflations, COL
- Government policies, Laws and Regulations: Pay-Equity Act
- Stakeholders: board, employees
- Cultures and customs: high-performance and focus internal equity.

### organisation factors
- strategy
- technology
- human capital
- HR policy
- Employee acceptance
- Cost implications

## internal labour markets
> rules and procedures that determine pay for different jobs within single organisation and allocate employees among those different jobs.

## Strategy for designing internal structures.
| Tailored    | Loosely Coupled    | Egalitarian | Hierarchical |
|---------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Adapted by organisation with low costs   | Adapted by organisaion require constant innovation    | Few levels | multiple levels |
|  well-defined jobs with detailed paystructure   | Pay structure are more loosely linked to organization   | smaller differentials | detailed job description |
| McDonald   | Job are flexible, adaptable and changing   | Equal treatment = knowledgable feels underpaid |  |
|            |           | higher performance when collaboration is required | higher performance when workflow depends on individual effort. |


## Equity theory: fairness
- compare ratio of their own outcomes

## Tournament theory
- relationship between motivation and performance

## Institutional theory
- Copy others and conform
- use "best practices"
- align for one organisation might not align with another

## Consequences.
_for internally-aligned Pay Structure_
- efficiency
- fairness
- compliance
