Why writing?

> Writing as [crystallised] thought, a way of expressing the labyrinth of interconnected, messy, and many time incoherent ideas in my mind. It is a form of [knowledge distillation](https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/knowledge-distillation) (Jacky on [writing](https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/writing))

Writing is an exploration, an excavation of self and the world in this painfully intricate dance. It is a way to bridge the chasm between ideas, to extend a filament of one consciousness to others. It is an extension of self, a second brain, where bounded by constraining nets of syntax and grammar, providing grounds for freedom of expression and articulate one's interests and curiosity.

> The thing I like about writing is that it’s quite literally _thinking_—a way for me access my own interiority and construct something from it. What I write is all mine, it’s a living thing, it’s an extension of me that wanders out into the world. It is desire turned inwards instead of outwards, focused instead of displaced. It’s a way to access self-knowledge and self-respect. (Ava on [how to avoid half-heartedness](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/how-to-avoid-half-heartedness))

In a sense, its modality on text creates an universal interface for people from vast backgrounds and context to create complex networks of thoughts. 

You see, I think writing is this pursuit of clarity in the midst of chaos, a striving to impose some semblance of order on the boundless and unpredictable swirl of sensations, feelings, and thoughts that define our existence. It’s a way to connect, to say: "This is me, this is the world as I see it, and is it the same for you?" It's a cry out into the void, a hope that someone out there hears it and answers back, creating a tiny but vital link of understanding and empathy in the sprawling, tangled web of human existence.

And yet, in the same breath, writing is the acknowledgement of the impossibility of total understanding, the acceptance of the intrinsic, ineradicable loneliness of the human condition. It's a reaching out despite the knowledge that total connection is impossible, a continual striving against the essential unreachability of others’ inner worlds. Such paradox, the agony and the ecstasy of writing, the pull between the desire for connection and the recognition of fundamental solitude.
