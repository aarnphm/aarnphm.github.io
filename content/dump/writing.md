Why writing?

> Writing as [crystallised] thought, a way of expressing the labyrinth of interconnected, messy, and many time incoherent ideas in my mind. It is a form of [knowledge distillation](https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/knowledge-distillation) (Jacky on [writing](https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/writing))

Writing is an exploration, an excavation of self and the world in this painfully intricate dance. It is a way to bridge the chasm between ideas, to extend a filament of one consciousness to others. It is an extension of self, a second brain, where bounded by constraining nets of syntax and grammar, providing grounds for freedom of expression and articulate one's interests and curiosity.

> The thing I like about writing is that it’s quite literally *thinking*—a way for me access my own interiority and construct something from it. What I write is all mine, it’s a living thing, it’s an extension of me that wanders out into the world. It is desire turned inwards instead of outwards, focused instead of displaced. It’s a way to access self-knowledge and self-respect. (Ava on [how to avoid half-heartedness](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/how-to-avoid-half-heartedness))

The modality of text essentially creates a universal interface that allows individuals from diverse backgrounds and contexts to form intricate networks of thoughts.

> What I am doing right now, writing this essay, is, technically, **a linear walk through the network of my ideas**. That is what writing is: turning a net into a line. But it is also very concretely what I do, since I have [externalised] my ideas in [a note-taking system](https://obsidian.md/) where the thoughts are linked with hyperlinks. (Henrik Karlsson, [Reader-generated Essay](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZtMsyMP5F7zzP8Gvc/reader-generated-essays))

At its core, writing endeavours to transmute the chaos of existence into discernible narratives, offering a conduit for shared understanding amidst the inherent disarray of life. Such a form of [lossiness in mutation](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/hypertext-montage)

# paradox.

You see, I think writing is this pursuit of clarity in the midst of chaos, a striving to impose some semblance of order on the boundless and unpredictable swirl of sensations, feelings, and thoughts that define our existence. It morphs into a bridge, spanning the chasm among individuals, carrying it across the echo: "This is me, this is the world as I see it, and is it the same for you?"

It's a reverberation in the void, fuelled by a yearning that amidst the boundless human tapestry, there exists a soul that perceives the echo, reciprocates the sentiment, and in doing so, forges a minuscule yet profound filament of comprehension and empathy.

And yet, writing is an acknowledgement of the indelible solitude inherent to human existence. It is a quiet concession to the insurmountable walls that encase individuals' inner sanctum. The act of writing is both a defiance of and a homage to the impenetrable mystery that shrouds the heart of another. Its delicate endeavour to articulate the inarticulable, to unveil the veiled, all the while knowing the quest may never consummate in total understanding.

In this paradox lies the profound beauty and torment of writing. It’s a ceaseless sojourn towards the horizon of connection, propelled by a boundless hope and a quixotic resolve, yet shadowed by the solemn acceptance of inherent disconnection. This complex interplay births the agony and the ecstasy of the writing voyage, the ceaseless pull between the allure of communion and the stark reality of intrinsic solitude.

> The pleasant parts of the internet seemed to be curated by human beings, not algorithms. For my writing to find its way in this netherworld, I needed to have a rough sense of how information flowed down there. The pattern was this: words flowed from the periphery to the centers. This was a surprisingly rapid stream. Then the words cascaded from the center down in a broader but slower stream to the periphery again.

> When writing in public, there is a common idea that you should make it *accessible*. This is a left over from mass media. Words addressed to a large and diverse set of people need to be simple and clear and free of jargon. It is valuable to write clearly of course, to a degree. Clear writing is clear thinking
