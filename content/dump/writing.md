# Writing

Why writing?

> Writing as [crystallised] thought, a way of expressing the labyrinth of interconnected, messy, and many time incoherent ideas in my mind. It is a form of [knowledge distillation](https://jzhao.xyz/thoughts/knowledge-distillation) (Jacky on [writing]())



> The thing I like about writing is that it’s quite literally _thinking_—a way for me access my own interiority and construct something from it. What I write is all mine, it’s a living thing, it’s an extension of me that wanders out into the world. It is desire turned inwards instead of outwards, focused instead of displaced. It’s a way to access self-knowledge and self-respect. (Ava on [how to avoid half-heartedness](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/how-to-avoid-half-heartedness))
