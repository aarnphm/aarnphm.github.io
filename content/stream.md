### how we talk about god

"God exists" – we say it like we're saying "the table exists." We use the same grammatical structure, same verb, same declaration of being, yet [[thoughts/Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinians]] would tell you these are performing different speech acts, i.e possessing different forms of life.

When someone tells me "I feel God's presence," I wonder what they're actually describing. Not the [[thoughts/Metaphysics|metaphysical]] claim – that's the easy part to dismiss. But the experience itself. The feeling of being held when no one's holding you. Of mattering when the universe gives no indication you do. Of not being alone in the dark when, objectively, you are.

These feelings are real. I've had them. Walking home at 3 AM and suddenly feeling like the street lights are watching over me. Finding a book at exactly the moment I needed it. That uncanny sense that things are aligning, that there's a pattern, a message, something speaking directly to you through the noise of existence.

Theism has this ready explanation as **providence**, i.e divine orchestration, i.e "God moving through your life", which is a very comforting way to reason about it.

When you strip that explanation away, you're left with something that is not "a coincidence" but a persistent feeling that it _means_ something. Your pattern-matching brain encountering random noise and insisting – _insisting_ – there's signal there.

"God is good" sounds like "water is wet" – a property of an existing thing. But maybe it's closer to "justice is sacred.", more of an orientation than a description afaict.
A way of being in the world, encoded in the grammar. The linguistic structure tricks you into thinking you're making claims about reality when you're actually describing how you're moving through it.

Kierkegaard said faith requires [[thoughts/Camus|absurdity]] – you leap beyond reason, beyond evidence, into belief. But sitting here now, I realize that we're all _leaping_ anyway. Every morning. Into relationships we know will end. Into projects that will be forgotten. Into futures that terminate, always, in death.

The absurdity isn't in believing something without evidence. The absurdity is pouring coffee at 7 AM when you _know_ – really know, not just intellectually but in your bones – that the heat death of the universe is coming. That nothing you do will persist. That entropy wins, always, in the end.

And yet here we are. Making breakfast. Answering emails. Planning for next Tuesday.

This isn't faith in the Kierkegaardian sense – there's no transcendent leap into the arms of God. But there's still a leap. You're acting _as if_ things matter despite having no cosmic guarantee they do. Building despite impermanence. Loving despite loss. Creating despite destruction.

Maybe that's what religious language is really expressing – not metaphysical claims but this fundamental human insistence on continuing. On treating temporary patterns as if they're eternal truths. On finding meaning in noise because meaning-making is what conscious matter does.

The [[/posts/feelings|feeling]] of being held. Of mattering. Of not being alone. These persist even after you've dismantled the theological framework. They're built into the architecture of consciousness itself – this need for connection, for significance, for something beyond the merely material. Not because there's a God out there responding to you, but because you're the kind of system that generates these feelings when confronting its own existence.

Strip away providence and you're left with a _pattern-matching systems encountering randomness and desperately trying to read it as text_.

As message. As meaning. We can't help it. It's how we're built.

The grammar of theism gives us a vocabulary for these experiences. But the experiences themselves? They're just what happens when consciousness encounters itself in a universe that doesn't care. When the meaning-making machine meets the meaningless void and keeps making meaning anyway.

Not despite the void. Through it. Because of it.

Generation without guarantee. Creation without cosmic permission. Love without eternal preservation.
