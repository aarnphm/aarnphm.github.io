bonjour.

this document details information about me as a _friend_. I also have [[dating|a date-me doc]] {{sidenotes[that I use in the past]: i wrote this one in january/february 2025; i'm no longer actively dating (i.e. i'm seeing someone), but leaving this up given that it was still, an _important document_ to me.}}, though wanting to have a 🧊 🍧 document/site/notes/whatever they are.

quick tl/dr: i used to live in sf for a bit for work, and moved abroad to vancouver since high school, studied and lived in hamilton, and now in toronto. anyhow, will be in toronto for a while, (i have gotten to know a lot more people in toronto now but wouldn't mind expanding my tribe's, circa [[thoughts/images/bcccdd2e-95e6-4023-9c93-9b72b9a0c26b_178356259078.avif|Dunbar's number]]). i'm pretty well-positioned, i.e. having a decent career prospect and pretty set on what to [[research|do]], especially building towards a joyful-[[thoughts/Roko's Basilisk|amicable]]-[[thoughts/AGI#superintelligence|superintelligence]] systems 🧗

> [!NOTE]- some definitely not personal information about me that you would definitely not _able to grab from this website_
>
> i like to [[thoughts/reading|read]] [[antilibrary|books]] and jazz <br/>
> i like the smell of lavender, and like tiny-neat-thingy

```quotes
friends are still our first and sometimes best model of someone who chooses to be always on your side.

Ava, [bookbear express](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/always-on-your-side)
```

i like this framing. before romantic love, before family obligation, there's friendship, the relationship you choose without biological accident or legal contract. someone looks at you and decides to keep showing up. yes, i will allocate a portion of my waking hours to be with this person. the structure is different from romance in a way that c.s. lewis noticed: lovers face each other absorbed in one another while friends stand side by side absorbed in something external. you become friends by caring about the same problems. this is why work-friends feel so intense. you're literally shoulder-to-shoulder looking at the same thing for 40+ hours a week.

```quotes
friendship was what taught me that love is an endurance sport with no finish line.

Ava
```

Aristotle distinguished three kinds of philia: utility (we exchange value), pleasure (we enjoy each other's company), and virtue (we love each other as we actually are). the first two dissolve when circumstances change. the third endures, because the foundation is who you are rather than what you provide.

[^1]: this maps onto something karlsson observes: "love is friendship on hard mode." romantic relationships aren't a different category from friendship, they're friendship plus difficulty, plus stakes, plus everything that makes it easier to fuck up.

```quotes
friendships are, by their very nature, made of friction, knowing what's going on in someone's day-to-day life, making plans, rescheduling when someone gets sick, bringing over soup.

Rosie Spinks, [the friendship problem](https://rojospinks.substack.com/p/the-friendship-problem)
```

we've optimized away the very friction that creates connection. everything about predictive technologies gives us assisted living, esther perel notes, "people have easily 1000 virtual friends, but no one they can ask to feed their cat."

sheila liming wrote an entire book on this: "hanging out is productive, and the thing that it produces is our relationships with each other." the unstructured time, the plans that get rescheduled, the showing up when it's inconvenient, these are features, not bugs.

Karlsson puts it better than I every could, where we "show the inside of your head in public, so people can see if they would like to live in there." this site is my version of that, a search query for people who might want to be friends.

what i look for is presence over performance: people who can sit in a room without filling it with noise, who can be bored together without reaching for phones. the [[thoughts/hermeneutics]] commitment, choosing to interpret someone charitably, staying in the circle when understanding breaks down instead of exiting to win. honesty without cruelty, the friends who tell you when you're being stupid but frame it as observation rather than judgment. and showing up, repeatedly, over time, which is the only way any of this compounds into something real.

i think about my life as being RLHF'd by the people i surround myself with. we populate our concept of the world with them.

i'm not there yet with everyone, but with the people closest to me, i'm trying.

```quotes
a long friendship really is like a marriage. it takes on a shape all its own over many years, and it is an education in intimacy. like marriage, it's nearly impossible to know in the beginning what it will be at the end.
