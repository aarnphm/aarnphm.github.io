bonjour.

This document details information about me as a _friend_. I also have a [[dating|date-me doc]] if {{sidenotes[you would like to see]: This profile was published in 2025; I'm no longer actively dating (i.e. I'm seeing someone), but still want to leave this up given that it was an important document for me.}}
