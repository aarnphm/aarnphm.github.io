You have stumbled upon my working notes, as do to all paths of this digital garden. This is pretty much inspired by [Andy's working notes](https://andymatuschak.org/)

Much of these notes/writings are written for my own consumption, a sort of [[tags/evergreen]] notes.
If any of these doesn't make sense for you, it is probably because I didn't write it for you.

My only ask for https://notes.aarnphm.xyz is to treat the sites as it. Most of other Quartz functionalities you can find on [main site](https://aarnphm.xyz)

You can start from some related [[/thoughts|topics]] that has been on my [[thoughts/Attention|mind]] these days,
or check out some [[thoughts/work|crafts]] I've been working on for the past while.

If you are into machine learning, you might be interested in some [[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability|introduction in interpretability]].

:wave: you can reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/aarnphm_) or checkout my [[/index|introduction blurb]]
