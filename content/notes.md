You have stumbled upon my working notes, as do to all paths of this [[thoughts/Digital garden|digital garden]]. This is pretty much inspired by [Andy's working notes](https://andymatuschak.org/)

Much of these notes/writings are written for my own consumption, a sort of #evergreen notes.
If any of these doesn't make sense for you, it is probably because I didn't write it for you.

My only ask for https://notes.aarnphm.xyz is to treat the sites as it. Most of other functionalities can be found on the <a href="https://aarnphm.xyz" target="_blank">main site</a>

You can start from some related [[/thoughts|topics]] that has been on my mind these days,
or check out some [[thoughts/work|crafts]] I've been working on for the past while.

You might be interested in [[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability|interpretable ml]],
or high performance [[thoughts/vllm|inference]] [[thoughts/LLMs|LLM]] engine, or #math notes, or a gentle introduction to [[thoughts/Attention|attention mechanism]] in [[thoughts/Transformers|transformer]] model.

There are also #tags/philosophy notes that I think about quite often. I consider myself to be within the rationalist camp, and I'm influenced by [[thoughts/Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein's writing]] as well as [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Friedrich Nietzsche]]
