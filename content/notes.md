Hi, I'm aaron. This is my working notes. This is inspired by [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/)

Much of these notes/writings are written for my own consumption, i.e. #evergreen notes. If any of these doesn't make sense for you, welp, touche 😅

This site began as a [[thoughts/Digital garden|digital garden]] (they still are) based of [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), but now it has morphed into a digital notebooks of mine. You can find out more about me <a href="https://aarnphm.xyz" target="_blank">at the apex domain.</a>

There are some relevant [[/thoughts|notes]] on I've been thinking about recently. I also [[thoughts/craft|work]] quite a bit these days.

Here are a few things that I like:

- [[thoughts/Wittgenstein]], [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[thoughts/Camus|Camus]]
- [[thoughts/love|romantic epistemology]]
- [[thoughts/Determinism|determinism]]
- [[thoughts/hermeneutics]]
- [[thoughts/functionalism]]
- Michel Foucault's The Archaeology of Knowledge
- [[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability|interpretability megalist]]
- high performance [[thoughts/vllm|inference]] [[thoughts/LLMs|LLMs]] engine
- dimension-3 #topology
- [[thoughts/homeomorphism]]
- Synchronizität (synchronicity)
