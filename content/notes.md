title: procedural notes.

Hi, I'm aaron. This is my working notes. This is inspired by [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/)

Much of these notes/writings are written for my own consumption, i.e. #evergreen notes.
If any of these doesn't make sense for you, welp, touche 😅

The notes were started out as a [[thoughts/Digital garden|digital garden]] of sort (they still are) based on [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/). You can find out more about me <a href="https://aarnphm.xyz" target="_blank">on this spot of the internet.</a>

There are some relevant [[/thoughts|notes]] that I've been thinking about recently, or check out some [[thoughts/work|of the work]] I've done in the past.

You might be interested in [[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability|interpretability]],
high performance [[thoughts/vllm|inference]] [[thoughts/LLMs|LLM]] engine, #math notes, #philosophy notes,
or [[posts/structured decoding|structured generations in inference engine]]

I'm influenced by [[thoughts/Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] as well as [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] (Nietzsche's books are what I considered #evergreen books, i.e living in my bags permanently)
