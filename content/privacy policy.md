**Effective date**: February 21, 2025

_Last updated_: February 21, 2025

This Privacy Policy applies to https://aarnphm.xyz and its subdomains (collectively, "the Site"), a personal website
operated by Aaron ([[/|me]]), showcasing my work, interests, and research. By using the Site, you agree to this policy.

### Information we collect

I don’t actively collect personal information unless you choose to email me. Here’s what happens:

1. Email Contact: If you email me at [contact\[at\]aarnphm.xyz](mailto:contact@aarnphm.xyz), I collect your
   email address and any details you provide to respond to you.
2. I use [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics (a simple, privacy Google Analytics alternatives). You should refer to their sites if you have any concern.
3. I host and use everything on Cloudflare (Workers, R2, KV, Email), and their analytics gives me more performance-related metrics, and I don't think that they track IP there? (If this is not the case, let me know!).

### Uses of information

I only collect the stats and just want to understand the distributions of continents visitors stumble upon my sites. :smiley:
At the end of the day, this is my personal site, _I'm not going to sell you anything_ [^stripe]

I don’t share your personal data with anyone, except if legally required (e.g., by a court order).
Third-party services like Cloudflare may process data for security, per their own policies. But tbf I don't collect any, so not entirely sure how :smiley:

[^stripe]: The only reason this page exists is because Stripe requires a Privacy Policy for my [Substack](https://livingalonealone.com/). I'm very fortunate to have a full-time jobs while still able to enjoy the art of [[thoughts/writing|writing]]

### Rights

You have all the rights lmao I don't collect anything.

Don't email me if you prefer not to share your info -- it's optional! Though would always like to grab a coffee chat if you have anything interests to talk about. Though I would recommend going visiting [my working notes](https://notes.aarnphm.xyz) to see what I'm up to nowadays.

### Security

SSL and everything standard web security stuff are enabled by default. DDOS and different CDN zones are also enabled for best browsing experience. I tried my best for web [[colophon|accessibility]] but there are certain ceiling that I can compromise without ruining the sites' experience.

### International users

The Site is hosted on Cloudflare, and I'm currently reside in Canada, so policies and relevant enquires are subjected to both Canadian and US laws.

### Children’s privacy

The Site isn't for kids,, in general. If you are a parent and think that your kids shouldn't use this website, then teach them, I don't have any responsibilities for how your kids browse the internet :smiley:

### Changes

I might tweak this policy later. Changes will be posted here with an updated date.
Check back if you’re curious.

### Contact

Questions? Contact me at [contact\[at\]aarnphm.xyz](mailto:contact@aarnphm.xyz).

### Legal

This policy and the Site are governed by Ontario, Canada laws. Any disputes go to courts there.
