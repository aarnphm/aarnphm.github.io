title: Determinism
---

deeply connected with our understanding of the physical science and their explanatory ambitions, on the one hand, and with our view about human free action on the other.

however, in both these general areas there is no agreement over _whether determinism is true_, and what the import for human [[thoughts/Agency|agency]] would be in either {{sidenotes[case]: or even whether it can be know true or false.}}

## causal

> the idea that every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions together with the laws of nature.

The idea is ancient, but first became subject to clarification and mathematical analysis in the eighteenth century.

## nominative determinism

> people tend to gravitate towards areas of work or interest that fit their name.
