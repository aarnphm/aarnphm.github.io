## system

current[^1] education system is not designed to inspire curiosity, and it would keep being this way unless the definition quality of success and quality moves to a more holistic measures.

University should be a place for you to think, not to always be right. It should encourage a form of [[thoughts/play|intellectural playfulness]] and [[thoughts/Agency|agency]] for explore.

## teaching

I do think that professor should use more primary sources, less secondary. Secondary sources are curated and [[thoughts/reductionism|compressed]] the amount of information being given.

Compression can lead to [[thoughts/confirmation bias|confirmation bias]], but saturation of information also overloads the students.

### [[thoughts/Constructionist]] critique[^2]:

Too many tools and too much space: Large space should start small, and widen, rather than having everything readily available
