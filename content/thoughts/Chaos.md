> Chaos: a looseness [collection](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/self-organizing-ideas) of one's [[thoughts/Will|will]] to life.

The etymology of chaos traces back to the Greek word χάος (khaos), meaning which means abyss, that which gapes wide open, that which is vast and [empty](https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/chaos-meaning-and-history)

## as system.

See also [[thoughts/papers/Chaos as an intermittently forced linear system.pdf|Chaos as an intermittently forced linear system]]

Chaos theory posits that within the apparent randomness of complex system lies an underlying pattern, self-similarity, and self-organization.

The amount of time in which a system can be predicted is dependent on the following:

- how much uncertainty can be tolerated in the forecast.
- accuracy of measuring current state of the system.
- A time scale, often known as [[thoughts/Lyapunov time|Lyapunov time]]

We can often see [[thoughts/Entropy|entropy]] as a consequence of chaos. These are often linked, yet distinct concepts.

The loss of order induces unpredictability within deterministic systems, or such systems are _sensitive dependent_ on initial condition. Whereas entropy deals with property of how one system can be arranged.

We can observe this through Lorenz attractor:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{dx}{dt} &= \sigma(y - x), \\
\frac{dy}{dt} &= x(\rho - z) - y, \\
\frac{dz}{dt} &= xy - \beta z.
\end{align*}
$$

## as time.



## fundamentals.

What [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] would imply:

> Alas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow of his longing beyond man—and the string of his bow will have unlearned to whizz!
>
> I tell you: one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing star. I tell you: ye have still chaos in you.

_extracted from Z V, Death of The God_

Chaos is the essence of one existence. Such that the world is not governed by fixed rules and predetermined order.
Nietzsche rejects [[thoughts/Transcendentals|transcendentals chaos]], such construct reality beyond sensory understanding. These truths are [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche#Prejudices of Philosophers|philosophers' prejudices]] that deny one's will to [[thoughts/Will#as power.|power]], such that all truth are just one's perception and experience.

- "eternal recurrence" [^1] - a litmus test for an individual's capacity to affirm life <- Actively mentioned throughout [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche#Thus Spoke Zarathustra|Thus Spoke Zarathustra]].
  - implies the possibility of composite [[thoughts/papers/Nietzsche the Kantian Self and Eternal Recurrence.pdf|self]], that the individual remains the same for eternity of life.
  - allows chaos to remain the force of life, and will to power to be a configuration of chaos.
    > The self, for Nietzsche, is not just a radically unstable postmodern self.  It is such a self, but it is not simply such a self.  It also has a stability, sameness, and unity that goes far beyond anything Kant ever imagined in his wildest dreams

The Übermensch must find his footing, create his own values through labyrinth of life. Chaos is important for the creation of anything that is truly new and valuable.

## versus equanimity.

Equanimity should be one to seek, but yet chaos is all I desire. (moment of chaos, moment of equanimity)

The rule of a utilitarian is to maximize desire at all cost, therefore, does it mean I should always seek chaos?

Nietzsche would argue that the motion of chaos invokes entropy, and entropy induces value, and the Übermensch embarks upon the creation of value.

[[thoughts/taste|Taste]] implies multiplicity of being. It is driven by inner chaos to explore and expands on our [[thoughts/Language|representation]] of the world.
Yet ignorance seems to overload chaos, and prevents the maximum utilization of ones potential. I wonder if chaos is just a collection of different entropic phenomena
