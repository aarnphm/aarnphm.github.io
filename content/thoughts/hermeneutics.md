Understanding is not finding; it's making. You enter another's world not by observing from outside but by participating. The hermeneutic circle: you can't grasp the whole without the parts, can't grasp the parts without the whole. You're always already inside.

## the circle

Hermeneutics is the practice of interpretation. Not just text, but persons, practices, forms of life. The method: shuttle between part and whole until you achieve a working understanding. Never final, always provisional. [@gadamer1960truth]

What does it mean to understand someone? Not to know facts about them—that's behavioral observation. To understand is to grasp _how_ they make sense of things, what distinctions matter to them, what possibilities they see. This requires entering their horizon of meaning.

## fusion of horizons

Gadamer: understanding happens through _fusion of horizons_ (_Horizontverschmelzung_). You bring your world, they bring theirs. Understanding emerges where they meet—not by one absorbing the other, but by creating shared space. [@gadamer1960truth]

Your horizon is your range of vision: everything that can be seen from your standpoint, shaped by history, language, practice. To understand another is not to leave your horizon but to expand it. Their distinctions become available to you. The circle widens.

This takes time. You can't speed-read a person. Deep reading is the model: return to difficult passages, sit with what resists you, let your categories be disrupted. [^book]

## attention as interpretive practice

Attention is not will. [[thoughts/Will]] tries to force understanding; attention waits. Will imposes your framework; attention lets the framework shift. The person you're attending to might reorganize your whole way of seeing—if you let them. [@weil1952gravity]

Iris Murdoch: moral life happens mostly in ongoing attention, not discrete choices. How you think about someone, how you imagine them, what you notice and what you ignore—this is where love operates. [@murdoch1970sovereignty] To see someone clearly requires discipline, a kind of spiritual exercise. You practice interpreting them charitably, checking your projections, staying open to revision.

This is hermeneutic humility: you might be wrong about them. Your current interpretation is provisional.

## ethical practice

Gadamer: understanding is practical wisdom (_phronesis_), not theoretical knowledge. [@gadamer1960truth] You don't apply universal principles; you interpret particular situations. What matters here? What does this context call for? This is ethical judgment, not calculation.

Paul Ricoeur: recognition requires narrative understanding. [@ricoeur1992oneself] You grasp someone by understanding their story—not just facts, but how they make sense of facts, what trajectory they see, what possibilities matter. To misrecognize is to impose your narrative, to refuse their interpretive authority.

Charles Taylor: strong evaluation depends on frameworks of meaning. [@taylor1989sources] What someone cares about, what distinctions they draw, what they find significant—this is their framework. Ethical understanding requires grasping their framework, letting it matter to you, even when it differs from yours.

Axel Honneth: self-realization depends on being recognized. [@honneth1995struggle] You need to be attended to, interpreted charitably, taken seriously. Hermeneutic injustice: when interpretive resources can't grasp your experience, or when others refuse to update despite evidence. Ethical hermeneutics fights this: commit to recognizing accurately, expanding your framework when it fails, staying in the circle.

Interpretive justice: who gets to interpret whom? Whose framework counts as legitimate? Hermeneutics can perpetuate power (imposing interpretation) or resist it (recognizing interpretive authority, expanding horizons).

For [[/posts/love|love]] as hermeneutic commitment, see [[thoughts/love]].

## what it's not

Not: projecting your needs onto them and calling it understanding.
Not: "reading their mind" or claiming privileged access.
Not: understanding _about_ them (facts, categories) instead of understanding _them_ (their horizon).

Not: assuming understanding is stable. People change. Your fusion of horizons must be redone, continuously. This is why love is a practice, not a possession.

## connection to [[thoughts/functionalism|functionalism]]

Can functional role capture what it means to understand someone? Maybe: understanding is the ability to predict, to intervene appropriately, to maintain the relationship under perturbations. Engineering criteria, not essence.

But hermeneutics resists reduction. If you treat someone as a functional system to be modeled, you've already stopped attending to them as _them_. You've made them an instrument of your prediction. The hermeneutic circle breaks.

Functionalism works for [[thoughts/LLMs]], for control systems, for role-playing. It might even work for surface-level social navigation. But loving someone? You need first-person engagement, not third-person modeling. You need to care about their horizon because it's _theirs_, not because it serves your goals.

This is the limit of compression: you can't compress a person to a model without losing what makes them a person. Attention resists compression. [@karlsson2025reading]

## wittgensteinian coda

> what does understanding _look like_ in practice?

Understanding as a language-game: the criteria are public (attention, responsiveness, staying with difficulty), but the significance is first-person (this particular person, this particular horizon, this particular text).

Interpretation is use. You understand someone when you can participate in their form of life, when their distinctions guide your action. Not perfect understanding—working understanding. Good enough to stay in the circle.

cf: understanding = fusion of horizons through sustained attention. ethical practice requires phronesis (practical wisdom), recognition (narrative authority), interpretive justice. practice, not theory. criteria, not essence.
