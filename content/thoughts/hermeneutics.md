Understanding is not finding; it's making. You enter another's world not by observing from outside but by participating. The hermeneutic circle: you can't grasp the whole without the parts, can't grasp the parts without the whole. You're always already inside.

## the circle

Hermeneutics is the practice of interpretation. Not just text, but persons, practices, forms of life. The method: shuttle between part and whole until you achieve a working understanding. Never final, always provisional. [@gadamer1960truth]

What does it mean to understand someone? Not to know facts about them—that's behavioral observation. To understand is to grasp _how_ they make sense of things, what distinctions matter to them, what possibilities they see. This requires entering their horizon of meaning.

## [[thoughts/ethics|ethical]] practice

Gadamer: understanding is practical wisdom (_phronesis_), not theoretical knowledge. [@gadamer1960truth] You don't apply universal principles; you interpret particular situations. What matters here? What does this context call for? This is ethical judgment, not calculation.

Paul Ricoeur: recognition requires narrative understanding. [@ricoeur1992oneself] You grasp someone by understanding their story—not just facts, but how they make sense of facts, what trajectory they see, what possibilities matter. To misrecognize is to impose your narrative, to refuse their interpretive authority.

Charles Taylor: strong evaluation depends on frameworks of meaning. [@taylor1989sources] What someone cares about, what distinctions they draw, what they find significant—this is their framework. Ethical understanding requires grasping their framework, letting it matter to you, even when it differs from yours.

Axel Honneth: self-realization depends on being recognized. [@honneth1995struggle] You need to be attended to, interpreted charitably, taken seriously. Hermeneutic injustice: when interpretive resources can't grasp your experience, or when others refuse to update despite evidence. Ethical hermeneutics fights this: commit to recognizing accurately, expanding your framework when it fails, staying in the circle.

Interpretive justice: who gets to interpret whom? Whose framework counts as legitimate? Hermeneutics can perpetuate power (imposing interpretation) or resist it (recognizing interpretive authority, expanding horizons).

For [[/posts/love|love]] as hermeneutic commitment, see [[thoughts/love#hermeneutics|this section]].

## what it's not

- projecting your needs onto them and calling it understanding.
- "reading their mind" or claiming privileged access.
- understanding _about_ them (facts, categories) instead of understanding _them_ (their horizon).
- assuming understanding is stable. People change. Your fusion of horizons must be redone, continuously. This is why love is a practice, not a possession.

## connection to [[thoughts/functionalism|functionalism]]

Can functional role capture what it means to understand someone? Maybe: understanding is the ability to predict, to intervene appropriately, to maintain the relationship under perturbations. Engineering criteria, not essence.

But hermeneutics resists reduction. If you treat someone as a functional system to be modeled, you've already stopped attending to them as _them_. You've made them an instrument of your prediction. The hermeneutic circle breaks.

Functionalism works for [[thoughts/LLMs]], for control systems, for role-playing. It might even work for surface-level social navigation. But loving someone? You need first-person engagement, not third-person modeling. You need to care about their horizon because it's _theirs_, not because it serves your goals.

This is the limit of compression: you can't compress a person to a model without losing what makes them a person. Attention resists compression. [@karlsson2025reading]

## [[thoughts/Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] coda

> what does understanding _look like_ in practice?

Understanding as language-game: criteria are public (attention, responsiveness, staying with difficulty), but significance is first-person (this particular person, this horizon, this text).

Interpretation is use. You understand when you can participate in their form of life, when their distinctions guide your action. Not perfect understanding—working understanding. Good enough to stay in the circle.

For detailed discussion of how criteria work in practice, see [[thoughts/love#criteria]].

cf: understanding = fusion of horizons through sustained attention. ethical practice requires phronesis (practical wisdom), recognition (narrative authority), interpretive justice. practice, not theory. criteria, not essence.
