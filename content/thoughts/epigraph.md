> [!math] definition
>
> A epigraph or _supergraph_ of a function $f: X \to [-\infty, \infty]$ valued in the extended real numbers $[-\infty, \infty]=\mathbb{R} \cup \{\pm \infty\}$ is the following set:
>
> $$
> \text{epi} f = \{(x,r) \in X \times \mathbb{R} : r \ge f(x)\}
> $$

which consists of all points in the Cartesian product $X \times \mathbb{R}$ ==lying on or above== the function's graph.

> A **strict** epigraph $\text{epi}_S f$ is the set of points in $X \times \mathbb{R}$ lying _strictly_ above its graph.
