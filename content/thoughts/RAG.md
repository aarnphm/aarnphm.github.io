Since models has finite memory, limited context windows, generations often leads to "hallucinations" and lack of cohesion

The idea of RAG is to combine a pretrained retriever and a seq2seq to do end-to-end fine tuning. (@lewis2021retrievalaugmentedgenerationknowledgeintensivenlp)

Two core components include [[thoughts/Embedding|embeddings]] and vector databases.

Very useful for building "agents": Agents are complex RAG application.
