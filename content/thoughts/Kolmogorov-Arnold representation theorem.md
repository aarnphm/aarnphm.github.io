_every multivariate continuous function_ $f: [0,1]^n \to \mathbb{R}$ can be ==represented== as superposition of continuous single-variable functions

> if $f$ is a multivariate continuous function, then $f$ can be written as a finite composition of continuous single-variable functions with binary operation of addition. Formally:

> where $\phi_{q,p} : [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ and $\Phi_q: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$
