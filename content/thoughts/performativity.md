captures how we enact rather {{sidenotes[^than express]}} [[thoughts/identity|identity]]

{{sidenotes[than express]}}:

    you become yourself through the performaces rather than having a "self" that represents yourself.

    This performance constitutes to who you are, and it blends with your _authentic self_.

## civilisation requires performance

[[library/Civilisation and its Discontents#performativity as structural necessity|freud's account]]: civilization forces performance out of structural necessity. the tripartite psyche means you can never simply "be yourself"—that would mean expressing id impulses directly, which civilization prohibits.

what you must perform:

**normalcy**: hide neurotic symptoms, present functional ego, appear as if internal conflicts don't constantly consume psychic energy. everyone is somewhat neurotic (civilization requires [[thoughts/repression|repression]]), but you can't show it too much.

**morality**: perform adherence to norms even when id impulses contradict them. show you've internalized prohibitions. the [[thoughts/guilt|superego]] monitors this performance—you feel guilty when the act slips.

**rationality**: present ego functions as conscious choice when often they're unconscious compromise formations. you don't know why you do what you do (unconscious determinism), but you must narrate yourself as rational agent making deliberate choices.

key insight: this isn't optional affectation. performance is structural requirement for social existence. by the time you speak (ego function), you've already suppressed id content and ventriloquized superego prohibitions. what gets communicated is neither pure desire nor pure moral ideal but what survives psychic censorship process.

## sartre: bad faith and authenticity

[[thoughts/identity#bad faith|sartre's existentialism]] adds: you know you're performing. awareness creates bad faith—lying to yourself about your freedom.

**bad faith**: pretending your performances are necessary, natural, inevitable rather than chosen. the waiter who over-performs being-a-waiter, treating social role as if it's his essential nature. he's lying to himself about his freedom to be otherwise.

**authenticity**: recognizing your performances as performances. acknowledging your freedom and taking responsibility for your choices. authentic person knows they're performing social roles but consciously chooses how to perform rather than performing unconsciously.

but sartre's demand for authenticity might be too strong. freud would object: you can't simply choose to stop performing. the mechanisms (repression, superego formation) operate unconsciously. you don't have transparent access to your motives. recognizing you're performing doesn't give you freedom from the performance—you remain subject constituted by forces you didn't choose.

tension: sartre emphasizes radical freedom (you could always choose otherwise). freud emphasizes unconscious determinism (you don't know why you do what you do; past shaped you in ways you can't access). both acknowledge performance, but disagree on whether authentic alternative exists.

## goffman: dramaturgical sociology

goffman's "presentation of self in everyday life" (1956) treats all social interaction as theatrical performance:

**front stage**: where performances happen. you manage impressions, maintain character, follow scripts appropriate to setting. the waiter in restaurant, the teacher in classroom, you at job interview—all front stage performances.

**back stage**: where you prepare for performances and drop the act. kitchen where waiters complain about customers, faculty lounge where teachers gossip, your apartment after the interview. back stage is where "real self" supposedly appears.

**audience**: others whose reactions matter. you perform for audience, adjust performance based on their responses, try to control what they perceive.

**teams**: people who cooperate to maintain shared performance. colleagues who present united front to clients but disagree privately. family members who maintain appearance of harmony for outsiders.

but crucial question: is there "real self" back stage? or is back stage just different performance for different audience? goffman sometimes suggests back stage is authentic, other times suggests it's performances all the way down.

connection to freud: even alone (back stage), you perform for internalized audience (superego). you watch yourself as others watch you. sartre calls this "being-for-others"—the Other's gaze becomes internalized. there might be no back stage in psychoanalytic sense—you never stop performing for someone (even if that someone is internalized).

## butler: gender as performative

butler's "gender trouble" (1990) radicalizes performativity: gender isn't something you have or express; it's something you do, repeatedly, that creates appearance of stable identity.

**performativity vs. performance**: performance suggests actor who exists prior to act. performativity suggests act creates actor. there's no gender identity behind expressions of gender; the expressions constitute the identity.

**compulsory repetition**: you must repeatedly cite gender norms. performing femininity/masculinity once isn't enough—requires constant reiteration. this repetition creates illusion of natural, stable gender identity.

**no doer behind the deed**: nietzsche's insight applied to gender. we assume there's subject who does actions, but maybe there are only actions. "there is no gender identity behind the expressions of gender; that identity is performatively constituted by the very 'expressions' that are said to be its results."

**subversion through repetition**: since gender requires repeated performance, there's space for variation. perform it slightly wrong, exaggerate, recombine elements. drag exemplifies this—makes visible the performative structure usually naturalized.

freudian connection: if superego is internalized social norms linguistically transmitted, then gendered superego transmits gender norms. performing gender isn't just social display but psychic structure. you feel [[thoughts/guilt|guilty]] for gender nonconformity because superego monitors gender performance.

but butler goes beyond freud: she questions whether there's any "real" identity beneath social construction. freud assumes id exists prior to socialization (primal drives). butler suggests social construction goes all the way down—no authentic desire beneath or before cultural inscription.

## phenomenology: no self prior to social relations

[[thoughts/identity#phenomenology|merleau-ponty's intercorporeality]]: you become yourself through others. the body is not private interior then publicly expressed; it's fundamentally social, relational, intercorporeal from the start.

this challenges authentic/performance distinction. if self is constituted through social relations, then performances aren't masks over real self—they partially constitute self. you discover who you are partly through how others respond to you.

ricoeur on narrative identity: you understand yourself through stories you tell about yourself. but those stories use culturally available narrative forms, respond to others' interpretations, incorporate social roles and expectations. narrative identity is co-authored—you and your social world together write who you are.

implications: "authentic self" isn't recovered by stripping away social performances. rather, authenticity might mean consciously engaging with how you're socially constituted, taking responsibility for performances while recognizing their social nature.

## the authentic/performed distinction collapses

multiple traditions converge: maybe there is no authentic self beneath performances.

**freud**: by the time ego operates (conscious self), you've already internalized social norms (superego) and repressed socially unacceptable desires (id censored). what feels like "your" thoughts are already shaped by social forces.

**wittgenstein**: [[thoughts/Wittgenstein|meaning is use]] within [[thoughts/forms of life|forms of life]]. even most private thoughts use language learned socially. you think in categories, concepts, distinctions that are cultural. private experience requires public criteria.

**phenomenology**: self is intercorporeal, constituted through relations with others. no pre-social self to discover.

**butler**: performativity without performer. expressions create identity rather than expressing pre-existing identity.

**poststructuralism** (derrida, foucault): the subject is produced by power/discourse, not prior to it. there's no authentic origin to return to.

yet this creates paradox: if it's performances all the way down, what does it mean to perform "authentically" vs. "inauthentically"? distinction seems to collapse. everyone is performing; no one can do otherwise.

## salvaging authenticity?

several attempts to preserve meaningful distinction:

**1. conscious vs. unconscious performance**: authentic = performing with awareness. you know you're performing, choose how to perform, take responsibility for performance. inauthentic = performing unconsciously, acting as if role is natural necessity, bad faith about your freedom.

but: freud shows much performance is necessarily unconscious. you can't make everything conscious. so this criterion is too demanding.

**2. freely chosen vs. coerced performance**: authentic = performances you choose. inauthentic = performances forced on you by social pressure, oppression, manipulation.

but: sartre's point—you're always free to refuse. social pressure is real but doesn't eliminate freedom. and freud's point—your "choices" are shaped by unconscious forces you didn't choose. so freedom criterion is complicated.

**3. consistent vs. fragmentary performance**: authentic = coherent self across contexts. same core values, personality, commitments whether at work or home. inauthentic = radically different performances in different contexts, no stable self.

but: goffman shows different contexts require different performances. demanding consistency across all contexts might be unrealistic. and postmodern view: fragmentation isn't failure of authenticity but truth about contemporary subjectivity.

**4. self-authored vs. socially scripted**: authentic = performances you create/improvise. inauthentic = following social scripts without variation.

but: butler shows all performance involves citing norms, following cultural scripts. pure self-authorship is impossible—you always work within/against cultural material. so this distinction is matter of degree, not kind.

**5. integrated vs. defended**: psychodynamic view—authentic = you've worked through conflicts, integrated different aspects of self, reduced need for rigid defenses. inauthentic = defended, dissociated, performing to avoid anxiety.

this might be most promising. it doesn't require transcending social construction but asks about relationship to your own psychic life. are you performing defensively (to avoid knowing something about yourself)? or flexibly (conscious of tensions, able to hold contradictions)?

## performance and relationships

implications for [[thoughts/love|love]] and [[thoughts/friendship|friendship]]:

**intimacy as lowered performance?** common view: intimate relationships involve dropping the act, showing "real self." but if there's no real self beneath performances, what is intimacy?

alternative: intimacy is different kind of performance. not more authentic (no authentic baseline) but more vulnerable, experimental, co-created. you perform differently in intimate relationship—more honest about conflicts, less defensive, more responsive to other—but it's still performance.

**mutual recognition**: [[thoughts/hermeneutics#recognition|ricoeur's ethics]]: authentic relationship involves recognizing other's autonomy while being recognized yourself. not about dropping masks to reveal truth but about acknowledging each other as subjects who interpret and perform.

**hermeneutic commitment**: [[thoughts/love#hermeneutics|love as hermeneutic practice]]: staying in interpretive process with someone. you're both performing, but you're trying to understand each other's performances, help each other become more conscious of what you're enacting, support experiments with different performances.

**creating space**: good relationships create space where you can perform differently—try out aspects of self that don't fit dominant social scripts, express conflicts without being rejected, experiment with vulnerability. not authentic expression but expanded repertoire of possible performances.

## political dimensions

performativity has radical political potential:

**denaturalization**: if gender, race, class, ability are performed (not natural), they're potentially changeable. exposing the performance undermines claims that current arrangements are inevitable.

**subversive repetition**: butler's strategy—perform norms slightly wrong, exaggerate them, recombine elements. drag, gender fuck, queer performance politics. by showing the performance, you undermine its naturalness.

**collective reimagining**: if identities are performatively constituted, communities can collectively perform new possibilities. consciousness-raising groups, queer community-building, disability pride—performing alternative identities brings them into being.

but also risks:

**performance as burden**: if everything is performance requiring constant work, this is exhausting. marginalized people already have to perform constantly (code-switching, managing impressions, emotional labor). performance theory shouldn't add to burden.

**losing critical standpoint**: if it's performances all the way down, what ground for critique? how to say this performance is oppressive, that one liberatory, if there's no authentic standard?

**voluntarism**: risk of suggesting people can just perform differently and be free. ignores material constraints, structural power, how some performances are rewarded while others are punished.

## questions and tensions

**1. is all behavior performance?** some argue embodied habits, spontaneous reactions, unconscious expressions aren't performances (no audience awareness, no impression management). others say even these are socially shaped, so still performative in broad sense. depends on how widely you define performance.

**2. can you ever stop performing?** alone, asleep, in flow state, early childhood—are these pre- or non-performative? or is unconscious/internalized performance still performance?

**3. is performance oppressive or constitutive?** negative view: performance is alienating, inauthentic, oppressive. positive view: performance is how we create meaning, relate to others, become ourselves. probably both—depends on context, constraints, consciousness.

**4. does rejecting authenticity eliminate normative standards?** if there's no authentic self to measure against, how to criticize harmful performances? need alternative normative framework—maybe based on harm reduction, expanding possibilities, reducing domination rather than achieving authenticity.

**5. what about sincerity?** classic worry: if everything's performance, nothing's sincere. response: sincerity isn't opposition to performance but quality of performance. sincere performance = you identify with what you're performing, it coheres with other performances, you'd defend it under reflection. insincerity = performing what you consciously disavow.

## performed all the way, but not "just" performed

view that emerges across traditions:

**no authentic self prior to performance**: you don't have fixed essential nature that performances express or betray. you become yourself through social practices, relationships, performances.

**not "just" performance**: but saying "it's just performance" is misleading. performances are real—they have effects, matter to people, constitute actual identities. "just" implies trivial, fake, dismissible. but performances create genuine selves, relationships, meanings.

**constraints and possibilities**: you perform within constraints (psychic structure, social norms, material conditions, linguistic resources). but constraints aren't deterministic—there's space for variation, creativity, subversion. you can't perform just anything (some performances are impossible given your situation), but you're not locked into one script either.

**consciousness matters**: aware performance differs from unconscious performance. not in being more authentic but in being more flexible, experimental, open to revision. psychoanalysis, consciousness-raising, critical reflection don't reveal true self but change relationship to your performances.

**relational achievement**: most meaningful performances are co-created through relationships. you discover who you are partly through how others receive you, respond to you, collaborate with you in performing shared meanings.

the deepest question: if it's performed all the way down, why does some performance feel authentic while other performance feels fake? maybe because "authentic" doesn't mean "non-performed" but rather: performed with awareness, flexibility, integration, responsiveness to actual situation rather than defensiveness, rigid scripts, or dissociation. authenticity as quality of performance, not alternative to performance.
