He is the hard one, but I respect rigorous discipline. It was known that the people in Königsberg often formed a routine surrounding his mode of living.

His work ethics are what I would aspire to be. Kant is also known to be rather paradigmatic with his whole ethical framework of reasons. In a way, we are living in a Kantian world, where there is a _universal concept_ of reason that transcend all linguistic and cultural boundaries.

In a way, Kant IS _emblematic of this certain notion of philosophy_.
