Hypothesis of language influencing thought

Linguistic relativity asserts that language influences worldview or cognition. One form of linguistic relativity, linguistic determinism, regards peoples' languages as determining and influencing the scope of cultural perceptions of their surrounding world.

> Various colloquialisms refer to linguistic relativism: the Whorf hypothesis; the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis; the Whorf–Sapir hypothesis; and Whorfianism. [^disclaimer]

[^disclaimer]: Although common, the term Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is sometimes considered a misnomer for several reasons. Edward Sapir (1884–1939) and Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897–1941) never co-authored any works and never stated their ideas in terms of a hypothesis. The distinction between a weak and a strong version of this hypothesis is also a later development; Sapir and Whorf never used such a dichotomy, although often their writings and their opinions of this relativity principle expressed it in stronger or weaker terms.

> [!important] linguistic determinism

> The strong hypothesis of linguistic relativity, now referred to as linguistic determinism, is that language determines thought and that linguistic categories limit and restrict cognitive categories. [^dispute]

[^dispute]: This was a claim by some earlier linguists pre-World War II; since then it has fallen out of acceptance by contemporary linguists. Nevertheless, research has produced positive empirical evidence supporting a weaker version of linguistic relativity: that a language's structures influence a speaker's perceptions, without strictly limiting or obstructing them.

The principle of linguistic relativity and the relationship between language and thought has also received attention in varying academic fields, including philosophy, psychology and anthropology. It has also influenced works of fiction and the invention of constructed languages.

## science and philosophy

Debates include innateness vs. constructivism/idealism/essentialism/relativism, and whether thought is internal speech or precedes language. In philosophy of language, positions range from direct representation of an objective world to views of categorization as subjective/arbitrary; other views emphasize language’s change and imperfect mapping to reality.

## artificial languages

Fiction (e.g., Rand’s Anthem, Orwell’s Newspeak) explores using language to constrain or shape thought. Constructed languages (Loglan, Láadan, Ithkuil, Toki Pona) explore how linguistic design might channel cognition.

## Programming languages

Kenneth E. Iverson argued notations are tools of thought; more powerful notations aid thinking. Paul Graham’s "Blub paradox" observes that thinking in a language can obscure awareness of more expressive ones. Ruby’s creator cited Babel-17 as inspiration.

## Science fiction

Works by [[thoughts/Orwellian|Orwell]], Jack Vance, Samuel R. Delany (Babel-17), Ted Chiang (Story of Your Life / Arrival), and Gene Wolfe explore linguistic relativity in speculative settings.

## sociolinguistics and linguistic relativity

Sociolinguistic variables (pronunciation, word choice, context, tone) may have implications for linguistic relativity.

## history

The idea was first expressed explicitly by 19th-century thinkers such as Wilhelm von Humboldt and Johann Gottfried Herder, who considered language as the expression of the spirit of a nation. Members of the early 20th-century school of American anthropology including Franz Boas and Edward Sapir also approved versions of the idea to a certain extent, but Sapir, in particular, wrote more often against than in favor of anything like linguistic determinism. Sapir's student, Benjamin Lee Whorf, came to be considered as the primary proponent as a result of his published observations of how he perceived linguistic differences to have consequences for human cognition and behavior. Harry Hoijer introduced the term "Sapir–Whorf hypothesis", even though the two scholars never formally advanced any such hypothesis. A strong version of relativist theory was developed from the late 1920s by Leo Weisgerber. Whorf's principle of linguistic relativity was reformulated as a testable hypothesis by Roger Brown and Eric Lenneberg, who performed experiments designed to determine whether color perception varies between speakers of languages that classified colors differently.

As the emphasis on the universal nature of human language and cognition developed during the 1960s, the idea of linguistic relativity became disfavored among linguists. From the late 1980s, a new school of linguistic relativity scholars has examined the effects of differences in linguistic categorization on cognition, finding broad support for non-deterministic versions of the hypothesis in experimental contexts. Some effects of linguistic relativity have been shown in several semantic domains, although they are generally weak. Currently, a nuanced opinion is espoused by most linguists: language influences certain kinds of cognitive processes in non-trivial ways, but other processes develop from connectionist factors. Research emphasizes exploring the manners and extent to which language influences thought.

### ancient philosophy to the enlightenment

The idea that language and thought are intertwined is ancient. In Plato’s dialogue Cratylus, he explores whether conceptions of reality are embedded in language. Plato has been read as arguing against sophists who claimed the physical world cannot be experienced except through language. Plato may have held that the world consisted of eternal ideas and that language should represent these ideas as accurately as possible. Plato's Seventh Letter claims that ultimate truth is inexpressible in words.

Following Plato, St. Augustine argued that language was merely like labels applied to concepts existing already. This opinion remained prevalent throughout the Middle Ages. Roger Bacon saw language as a veil covering truths. For Immanuel Kant, language was one of several methods used by humans to experience the world.

### german romantic philosophers

During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, ideas of different national characters (Volksgeister) motivated German romanticism and early ethnic nationalism.

#### Johann Georg Hamann

Hamann discussed the "genius" of a language, suggesting that a people's language affects their worldview:

> The lineaments of their language will thus correspond to the direction of their mentality.

#### Wilhelm von Humboldt

In 1820, Humboldt proposed that language is the fabric of thought; thoughts are produced as a kind of internal dialog using the same grammar as the thinker's native language. He held that the diversity of languages is a diversity of views of the world and that languages create an individual's worldview through lexical and grammatical categories, conceptual organization, and syntactic models.

### Boas and Sapir

The idea that some languages are superior to others was widespread in the early 20th century. Franz Boas challenged this, stressing the equal worth of all cultures and languages, holding that all languages can express the same content by different means. He required ethnographers to learn native languages and document verbal culture in the original language.

Boas:

> It does not seem likely [...] that there is any direct relation between the culture of a tribe and the language they speak, except in so far as the form of the language will be moulded by the state of the culture, but not in so far as a certain state of the culture is conditioned by the morphological traits of the language.

Sapir drew on Humboldt, argued that no two languages are sufficiently similar to represent the same social reality, and that the worlds of different societies are distinct, not merely different labels. Yet Sapir explicitly rejected strong determinism:

> It would be naïve to imagine that any analysis of experience is dependent on pattern expressed in language.

He emphasized that language and culture are not intrinsically associated and noted that a common language does not guarantee a common culture.

### independent developments in europe

Drawing on Humboldt and Nietzsche, European thinkers developed similar ideas. Leo Weisgerber proposed a 'linguistic inter-world'. Vygotsky studied how concept development in children is influenced by linguistic structure. Alfred Korzybski’s general semantics has been compared to Whorf’s notions.

### Benjamin Lee Whorf

Whorf [^cite] associated himself with the "linguistic relativity principle". Studying Native American languages, he attempted to account for how grammatical systems affect perception. Critics attribute to Whorf a strong determinism, while others point to his explicit rejections of determinism. Whorf wrote:

> We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language ... all observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be calibrated.

[^cite]: Whorf cited cases where non-European languages have several terms for a concept conveyed by a single word in SAE (Standard Average European). Examples include the oft-repeated claim about many Inuit words for snow (later contested) and distinct Hopi words for types of water. He also described a fire risk anecdote involving "empty" barrels, later criticized for causality.

### Time in Hopi

Whorf argued Hopi does not treat time as countable instances but as a single process, lacking nouns referring to units of time as in SAE languages. Ekkehart Malotki later claimed no evidence supported Whorf’s view, whereas relativists argued Malotki mischaracterized Whorf’s claims.

### Structure-centered approach

Lucy identified a structure-centered method: start from structural peculiarities and examine cognitive ramifications (e.g., Hopi time; Yucatec classifiers leading to material-based classification). Some philosophers argue Whorf’s translation-based arguments are self-refuting.

### Brown and Lenneberg

Lenneberg criticized Whorf’s evidence and emphasized demonstrating associations between linguistic and behavioral phenomena. With Brown, he proposed two tenets:

- The world is differently experienced and conceived in different linguistic communities.
- Language causes a particular cognitive structure.

Brown later formulated the well-known weak/strong versions:

- Structural differences between languages are paralleled by nonlinguistic cognitive differences.
- One’s native language strongly influences or fully determines the worldview acquired.

### Joshua Fishman's "Whorfianism of the third kind"

Fishman argued Whorf’s real interest emphasized the intrinsic value of "little peoples" and "little languages". He proposed that language is a key to culture.

### Leiden school

The Leiden school models languages as parasites. Frederik Kortlandt advocated a form of linguistic relativity and quoted Sapir on the power of words.

### Rethinking Linguistic Relativity

The 1996 anthology edited by Gumperz and Levinson began a new period, emphasizing cognitive and social aspects. Levinson documented spatial-category relativity (e.g., Guugu Yimithirr absolute directions). Lucy terms this a domain-centered approach. Space is a fruitful domain; some languages rely only on absolute frames, unlike English’s relative frames.

Separate studies by Bowerman and Slobin suggest some cognition develops independently of language; "thinking for speaking" processes are relevant to relativity.

## Colour terminology

### Brown and Lenneberg

They tested whether codability of color terms affects memory and recognition. Zuni speakers (grouping green/blue) had difficulty distinguishing within that category. This domain is constrained by perceptual universals.

### Hugo Magnus

In the 1870s, Magnus surveyed color naming across languages, warning that lexical gaps do not imply perceptual gaps. He found no lack of perception of red, yellow, green, blue; he did find widespread lexical neutralization of green/blue.

### Response to Brown and Lenneberg's study

Berlin and Kay proposed universal typological color principles, sparking work on universals. Relativists (Lucy, Saunders, Levinson) argued the study did not refute relativity due to assumptions (e.g., the status of color as a category) and data issues. MacLaury also found strong universal influences in color naming.

### Berlin and Kay

Despite variation, languages tend to converge on focal hues; with few color terms, selections are predictable (e.g., black/white/red for three-term systems). This pattern was taken as evidence against relativity, though critics note that color terms may encode more than color information.

## Universalism

Universalists (e.g., Chomsky) argue for universal grammar and largely innate structures; differences are surface phenomena. From the 1960s–1980s this view dominated, and relativity was often ridiculed.

### Ekkehart Malotki

Malotki challenged Whorf’s Hopi time claims with extensive data. Relativists maintain Whorf’s actual claim concerned different conceptualization, not absence of time.

### Steven Pinker

Pinker argues thought is independent of language and proposes "mentalese". Relativists accuse universalists of misrepresenting Whorf and using strawman arguments.

## Cognitive linguistics

Advances in cognitive psychology/linguistics renewed interest in Sapir–Whorf. George Lakoff emphasizes conceptual metaphors (e.g., time-as-money in English). Studies of grammatical gender effects have faced replication challenges and mixed large-scale corpus results.

### Parameters

Lakoff identified four parameters on which views of relativity differ:

- Degree and intensity of relativity.
- Whether conceptual systems are absolute or can evolve.
- Whether similarity is judged by translatability or usage.
- Whether emphasis is on language or the brain.

## Refinements

Researchers (e.g., Boroditsky, Choi, Majid, Lucy, Levinson) hold that language influences thought in limited, empirically supported ways. Brain lateralization offers additional perspective (e.g., right visual field effects in color tasks).

### Behavior-centered research

A behavior-based method compares behavior across linguistic groups, then seeks linguistic causes. Examples include Bloom’s counterfactuals in Chinese (later challenged), and Strømnes’s Finnish/Swedish factory accident analysis involving prepositions vs. cases.

#### Numbers and classifiers

Pirahã reportedly lacks numbers and color terms as typically defined, and certain clause types; universalists dispute conclusions. Experiments show classifier/gender systems can influence categorization, with effects diminishing under cross-linguistic exposure.

#### Time perception

Spatial metaphors shape temporal perception. English/Swedish tend to use distance (“long meeting”), Spanish often uses quantity (“big meeting”); these correlate with duration judgments. Mandarin employs vertical metaphors for time, showing corresponding processing biases.

#### Pronoun-dropping and intentionality

Pronoun use correlates with cultural individualism/collectivism. English speakers are more likely to specify agents for accidental events than Spanish speakers, who often use agent-neutral descriptions.

#### Future tense

Studies report that "futureless" languages correlate with more savings and healthier behaviors; within-language manipulations (e.g., repetitive "will" in Chinese) do not necessarily shift impatience, suggesting cultural or other factors may mediate effects.

### Psycholinguistic research

Work examines motion, emotion, object representation, and memory. The gold standard is to find non-linguistic cognitive differences across language groups. Bilingual studies explore effects of language vs. culture on time, space, motion, colors, and emotion; differences have been reported between bilinguals and monolinguals.
