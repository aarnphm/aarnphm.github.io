\begin{aligned}
\text{FR1} &. \text{ A variable standing alone is a wff} \\
\text{FR2} &. \text{ If } \alpha  \text{ is a wff, so is } \neg \alpha \\
\text{FR3} &. \text{ If } \alpha  \text{ and } \beta \text{ are wffs, then } (\alpha \cdot \beta ), (\alpha \space \beta), (\alpha \vee \beta ), (\alpha \supset \beta), \text{ and } (\alpha \equiv \beta) \text{ are wffs}
\end{aligned}
