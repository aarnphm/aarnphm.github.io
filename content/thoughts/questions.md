What is questions really?

People always say "there is no such thing as a stupid question", but I do think questions comes from innate ability and desire to learn, not coming from subjective opinion.

### Socratic method

[[thoughts/Socrates|Socrates]] are notoriously known for just asking questions and involve in such dialogue.

A method of hypothesis elimination, in that better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions.

A Socratic Circle is an approach to understanding texts. It is based off the assumption that all knowledge is a posteriori knowledge, all thinking comes from asking questions, and that one question should lead to asking further questions.

Students will then often involved in a Socratic [[thoughts/dialectics|dialects]], where inner circle will explore and ask questions, the outer circle will then provide feedback and vice versa.
