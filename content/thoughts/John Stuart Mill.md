On _Liberty_

> "There are but few persons... whose experiments, if adopted by others, would be likely to be of any improvement on established practice. But these few are the salt of the earth; without them, human life would become a stagnant pool. Not only is it they who introduce good things which did not before exist; it is they who keep the life in those which already exist." (252)

> "The general tendency of things throughout the world is to render mediocrity the ascendant power among mankind." (253)

> "The initiation of all wise or noble things comes and must come from individuals." (253)

> ""What crushes individuality is despotism" (251)

Experiments in living => praises for these people.

Liberty is limited by the requirements of _Do no harm_

Self-regarding actions vs. Other-regarding actions

Self: be as self, be as different
Other: Do no harm

If something is not-moral: Then Moral is wrong

Utilitarianism: Individual's expression

- not maximise pleasure
- but maximise **progress of humanity**

> Harmonious development of humanity

Unlimited regards to actions to self-regarding actions, but not other-regarding actions.

### Moral Individuality

As individuals as we do, but still be Morals to others

[[thoughts/moral|Moral]] is good thing. Ask [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s, what is good thing?
