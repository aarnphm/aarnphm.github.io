Concurrent, cache-efficient, and secure build system for building [[thoughts/OCI|OCI-compliant]] images and artifacts.

Containers are a form of [[thoughts/Content-addressable storage]], such that you can run your application within an isolated environment.

Marshaled as a protobuf message, see [definition](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/solver/pb/ops.proto)
