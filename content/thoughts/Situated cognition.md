title: Situated cognition
---

all knowledge is _situated_ in activity bound to social, cultural and physical contexts.

a model of knowledge and learning that requires thinking on the fly rather than the storage and retrieval of _conceptual_ knowledge, i.e cognition cannot be separated from context.

This is somewhat aligned with Heidegger's [[library/Being and Time|dasein]] (being-in-the-world) that rejects the notion of ::truly objective knowledge:: and Kantian empiricism
