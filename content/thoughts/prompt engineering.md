A constructive way to form communications with [[thoughts/LLMs]]. As we improve the quality of prompts, we can expect better results from the models. Similar to [[thoughts/linguistic]], a good prompt is a good form of communication with the system.

This is different from [[thoughts/zero-shot learning|zero-shot prompting]]

## CoT prompting

See also: [[thoughts/NLP]]

You can think of it as explaining a big topics to a five years old. You break down topic into smaller, logic parts that mimics a train of thoughts.

## Least-to-most prompting

Prompted to first list the sub-problems to a problem, then solve them in sequence.
