_Known through French thinkers Claude Lévi-Strauss or Piaget, methodological connection in social science to interpret human behaviour/controls under mathematical rules_

The underlying intrinsic to the mind that this structure is universal, in a sense of our own existence.

Levi-Strauss reckoned that the way we think about things has been set in place already by cultural factors (mainly language) - so the individual is almost a base through which ‘society’ does its work. Think about it like this - language existed before we were, and will continue after we will be gone, but we think through it and it constrains our understanding.

Think of Levi-Strauss as making an argument about society. In all of human history, there have only ever been about nine ways we've come up with to actually THINK about society.

- Marx (Marxism) makes an argument that society is about economic structures, and all behavior is constrained by it.
- Durkheim (structuralism) makes an argument that society is about institutions trying to come into balance with each other, like the organs in a body.
