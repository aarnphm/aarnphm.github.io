resources: [[thoughts/Overton Window|frame-context collapse]] and [OpenAI's on alignment research (before all the safety disband)](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research)

The act of aligning oneself with a particular group or ideology. This can be done for a variety of reasons, including:

- To gain social acceptance
- To gain power
- To gain resources

Often known as a solution to solve "hallucination" in [[thoughts/LLMs|large language models]] token-generation. [^enterprise]

[^enterprise]: In production use cases, systems solutions such as [[thoughts/RAG]] are more relevant where there are multiple components, or "sensors" involved to be factually correct with internal databases.

> To align a model is simply teaching it to generate tokens that is within the bound of the Overton Window.

The goal is to build a aligned system that help us solve other alignment problems

> Should we build a [[thoughts/ethics|ethical]] aligned systems, or [[thoughts/moral|morally]] aligned systems?

One of [[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability]]'s goal is to [[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability#ablation|ablate]] harmful features.

The idea is to create a standard for risk mitigation strategy when AI system advances. Essentially create a scale to judge "how capable a system can cause harm"
