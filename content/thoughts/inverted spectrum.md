whenever i think about inverted spectrum cases, i'm really just stress-testing how tightly i want to tie phenomenology to function.

the picture that hooks me: what if your red experiences are qualitatively identical to my green experiences? we both call ripe tomatoes \"red\" and grass \"green.\" we make the same discriminations, have the same preferences, show the same behaviors. functionally equivalent. but phenomenally inverted: your red-quale = my green-quale, your green-quale = my red-quale.

if that picture is coherent—even just as a thought experiment—then functional role doesn’t fix phenomenal character. same function, different [[thoughts/qualia|consciousness]]. my naive reaction is: in that world, bare [[thoughts/functionalism]] would be false or at least incomplete.

this is the inverted spectrum argument in a nutshell. philosophers have been pushing it around since locke. [@locke1689essay] shoemaker gives it a modern, more neuroscientifically aware form. [@shoemaker1982invertedspectrum]

## how i mentally set the case up

two ingredients my brain insists on if i’m going to take the case seriously:

1. **functional equivalence.** you and i have identical functional organization for color vision. same discriminations (red/green, red/orange), same perceptual judgments (\"that's red\"), same behavioral dispositions (stop at red lights), same learned associations (red means danger), same memory and comparison abilities.\n2. **phenomenal inversion.** what red looks like to you is what green looks like to me. systematically inverted across the spectrum, but functionally undetectable. no behavior, report, or functional test reveals the difference.\n\nif both can hold together, then phenomenal properties are distinct from functional properties. function doesn’t determine phenomenology. consciousness is something over and above causal role.

## the argumentative pressure (as i feel it)

the standard argument template:

1. **conceivability.** spectrum inversion feels conceivable: i can coherently picture two people functionally identical but phenomenally inverted.\n2. **conceivability → possibility (maybe).** if there’s no obvious contradiction, inversion might be metaphysically possible—or at least, nothing in the functional description itself seems to rule it out.\n3. **possibility breaks identity.** if a single functional role can be realized by different phenomenal characters (red-quale vs green-quale), then phenomenal character isn’t identical to functional role.\n4. **so bare functionalism looks incomplete.** functional organization doesn’t exhaust mental properties. [[thoughts/qualia]] start to look like extra facts.\n\nfor me this is softer than the [[thoughts/philosophical zombies]] move (which imagines complete absence of consciousness) but still unsettling. even if zombies turn out incoherent, inverted spectrum keeps the \"function underdetermines phenomenology\" vibe alive.

## is inversion really possible?

The intuitive answer: yes, obviously possible. Nothing contradictory about it. Phenomenology seems independent of function—what things feel like could vary while functional role stays fixed.

But closer inspection reveals problems:

**Asymmetries in color space.** Real color experiences have structural features: unique hues (pure red, green, blue, yellow that don't look mixed), opponent processes (red/green and blue/yellow are mutually exclusive), brightness/saturation dimensions. If you invert red/green, these structures break.

Red is a unique hue—doesn't look like mixture. Green is also unique. But if we invert them while preserving functional structure, we need to preserve uniqueness. Now "red" (your green-quale) looks unique and "green" (your red-quale) looks unique. But we've also inverted the opponent process: things that looked red-not-green now look green-not-red. Does the opponent structure stay functional (signals about wavelengths) or phenomenal (mutual exclusion in experience)? If functional: no problem for inversion. If phenomenal: the inversion creates contradictions (red-opponent-to-green becomes green-opponent-to-red, breaking the structure). [@hardin1988color]

**Learned associations.** Fire engines, stop signs, blood—all produce strong red-associations. If your red-quale = my green-quale, when you see fire trucks you experience... green? Does that green have danger-associations for you? If yes, phenomenology is shaped by functional role (associations, affordances, meanings). If no, your functional organization differs from mine (different affective responses, different learned connections). Either way, pure inversion looks impossible. [@shoemaker1982invertedspectrum]

Shoemaker's response: imagine inversion is congenital or very early. You grow up with inverted qualia. Fire trucks produce your green-quale, but you learn to call it "red" and associate it with danger. Functionally: same as me. Phenomenally: inverted. Associations track functional role (danger-response), not quale type. [@shoemaker1982invertedspectrum]

**Neurological constraints.** Maybe human color vision has functional structure that determines phenomenal structure. The three cone types, opponent processing in LGN, cortical color areas—perhaps this functional architecture suffices for phenomenal character. Invert the qualia and you've implicitly changed the functional structure. [@clark1985qualia]

Reply: this begs the question. The whole debate is whether functional structure determines phenomenology. Asserting they're inseparable doesn't argue for it. And anyway, the inversion thought experiment is metaphysical (about possibility), not empirical (about actual humans). Even if our functional structure determines our phenomenology, could there be creatures functionally identical but phenomenally different? If yes, functionalism is false in general.

## [[thoughts/functionalism|functionalism's]] responses

**1. Deny conceivability.** You haven't genuinely conceived inversion—you've imagined behavioral/functional equivalence while forgetting that phenomenal structure _is_ functional structure. Full functional specification includes phenomenology. [@dennett1988quining]

This is eliminativism about qualia: there are no phenomenal properties separate from functional properties. Talk about "what it's like" is just confused talk about functional discrimination and report. If you get the function right, you've got the phenomenology—no separate fact to invert.

Problem: seems to change the subject. The inverted spectrum trades on intuition that phenomenology is distinct from function. Denying the intuition doesn't refute the argument—it rejects the question.

**2. Include phenomenal character in functional role.** Expand the role: pain isn't just "caused by damage, causes avoidance." It's "state with phenomenal character Q, caused by damage, causes avoidance." Now inverted spectrum is ruled out by definition: different phenomenal character = different functional role. [@levin2024functionalism]

Problem: this blocks multiple realization. If phenomenal character is part of the functional role, systems with different phenomenology don't realize the same mental state. Aliens with different qualia but same behavior/cognition don't have the same mental states as us. That's very restrictive—loses one of functionalism's main virtues (substrate independence, multiple realizability).

And it doesn't explain phenomenal character—just labels it. You've added "has quale Q" to the role specification. That's not reduction; it's admission that phenomenal properties are additional to standard functional properties (causal relations, dispositions, computational structure).

**3. Richer functional roles.** Pain isn't just simple input-output mapping. It's place in whole network: relations to beliefs, desires, other sensations, learning, attention, memory, affective responses. Maybe this full functional network determines phenomenology. Can't invert one element (red-quale) without disrupting whole network. [@shoemaker1982invertedspectrum]

This is Shoemaker's own view. He thinks spectrum inversion is possible in principle (shows functionalism needs refinement) but increasingly implausible as you specify the full functional network. Phenomenal character is weakly emergent from, or strongly constrained by, rich functional organization.

But if the functional network determines phenomenology necessarily, we're back to type-identity (for that network). If it constrains but doesn't determine, inversion remains possible and functionalism is incomplete.

**4. Representationalism.** Phenomenal character = representational content. Red-experience represents surfaces with certain reflectance properties. If you and I represent the same properties (same discriminations, same perceptual judgments), we have the same phenomenal character. No room for inversion. [@tye1995ten]

Problem: seems to confuse represented content with phenomenal character. We might represent the same wavelengths/reflectances (same discriminations, same functional role) but experience them differently. The inverted spectrum is precisely this scenario: same represented content, different phenomenology.

Representationalists respond: phenomenal character _is_ the way properties are represented, and the representational format is fixed by functional role (how information is deployed, what behavioral/cognitive effects it has). Same function = same format = same phenomenology. [@dretske1995naturalizing]

But this just pushes the question back: why should functional role determine representational format? Why can't same functional role be implemented with different representational formats, hence different phenomenology?

## empirical approaches

Can we test for spectrum inversion empirically? Some attempts:

**Neural similarity.** Compare your color-processing neurons to mine. If patterns match for "red" stimuli, maybe phenomenology matches. If inverted, neural patterns should mismatch.

Problem: this assumes neural similarity entails phenomenal similarity. That's the question, not the answer. And which level matters—photoreceptors, LGN, V4, higher visual areas? Functional organization spans levels. Neural similarity at one level, difference at another—whose phenomenology differs?

**Color naming and categorization.** Cross-cultural studies show different languages carve color space differently. Maybe phenomenology tracks linguistic categories? If your language has more green terms, you experience more green distinctions.

But this conflates phenomenal difference with discriminative/categorical difference. The latter is functional (behavioral, judgmental). The question is whether functional difference entails phenomenal difference. If yes, spectrum inversion is impossible—which is to assume functionalism, not test it.

**Introspective reports.** Just ask people: "What does red look like to you? Could someone else have inverted qualia?"

Most people say: yes, it's conceivable. But conceivability judgments don't establish metaphysical possibility. And introspection about phenomenal character is notoriously unreliable—people confabulate, rationalize, misinterpret their own experiences. Not solid ground for settling metaphysical debates.

**Genetic/developmental variation.** Find people with atypical color vision (tetrachromats, anomalous trichromats). Compare their phenomenology to typical trichromats.

Problem: atypical vision is functionally different (different discriminations, different wavelength sensitivities). We want functional equivalence with phenomenal difference, not functional difference (which might or might not involve phenomenal difference). The inverted spectrum requires functional identity, which genetic variants don't provide.

## contemporary relevance

**AI and [[thoughts/LLMs]].** Could two AI systems have identical functional organization but different phenomenal character? If training procedures differ (different datasets, different architectures that converge to same function), maybe?

But if phenomenal character is determined by functional role, architectural/training differences that don't affect function shouldn't affect phenomenology. If phenomenal character varies independently of function, we have no way to tell whether AI systems have inverted qualia (or any qualia).

This is practical problem: if qualia can vary independently of function, behavioral tests and [[thoughts/Mechanistic interpretability|mechanistic interpretability]] won't tell you about consciousness. Functional decomposition gives you causal structure, not phenomenology. You need additional theory linking function to phenomenology—but the inverted spectrum suggests no such theory exists (or if it does, it's not functional theory).

**Comparative consciousness.** Do bats experience echolocation with unique phenomenal character? Do octopuses have visual qualia we can't imagine? [@nagel1974bat]

If functionalism is true, systems with similar functional organization have similar phenomenology. Different sensory modalities but similar downstream processing (discrimination, integration, memory) might produce analogous qualia.

If inverted spectrum is possible, functional similarity doesn't guarantee phenomenal similarity. Bat echolocation might feel like human vision, or completely different, or intermediate. No way to tell from functional analysis.

**Clinical dissociations.** Some conditions involve altered qualia without (obvious) functional deficit. Migraine auras, synesthesia, drug-induced perceptual changes. Do these show qualia varying independently of function?

Probably not—there are functional differences (altered sensory processing, cross-modal activation, binding failures). But the functional differences seem subtle compared to dramatic phenomenal differences. Suggests phenomenal character is more fine-grained than coarse functional role. Maybe functionalism needs very fine-grained functional specifications—at which point, is it still functionalism or just neural-type identity theory?

## the broader dialectic

The inverted spectrum is one of three classic [[thoughts/qualia]] arguments:

- **[[thoughts/philosophical zombies|Zombies]]**: functional equivalence, complete absence of consciousness. Hardest to defend (seems incoherent to many), strongest conclusion (consciousness is additional to physical facts).

- **Inverted spectrum**: functional equivalence, different phenomenal character. More defensible than zombies (less radical), still damaging to functionalism (shows functional role underdetermines phenomenology).

- **[[thoughts/knowledge argument|Knowledge argument]]**: complete functional/physical knowledge, ignorance about phenomenal character. Epistemic angle on same issue (explanatory gap between function and phenomenology).

All three arguments share structure: show that phenomenal properties can vary (or be unknown) while functional properties are fixed (or completely known). If the arguments work, phenomenology isn't reducible to function. Mental states aren't exhausted by causal roles.

Functionalists respond with: eliminativism (deny qualia), expansion (add phenomenal properties to role specification), representationalism (reduce qualia to representational content), or enrichment (appeal to fuller functional story including embodiment, learning, context).

No consensus. The inverted spectrum remains live issue in philosophy of mind.

## Wittgenstein's worry

Private language argument: could you even _know_ your qualia are inverted relative to mine? [@wittgenstein1953pi] The color words we use are defined by public criteria (pointing to objects, matching samples, discriminating). If we both call tomatoes "red" and grass "green," use color terms the same way, pass all behavioral tests—what makes it the case that your red-quale differs from mine?

Qualia are supposed to be private, intrinsic, directly known. But [[thoughts/Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]] argues: without public criteria, there's no fact of the matter about sameness/difference. "Whatever seems right is right—and that only means we can't talk about 'right.'" [@wittgenstein1953pi]

If he's right, the inverted spectrum is incoherent. Not because it's metaphysically impossible, but because the supposition lacks content. There's no private phenomenal character additional to functional/behavioral profile. Mental life is essentially public, constituted by participation in language-games and forms of life.

This is radical functionalism: mental properties are individuated by roles in public practices, not by private intrinsic properties. Qualia-talk is confused—confuses grammatical rules for referring to sensations with metaphysical properties.

But intuition rebels. Surely there's something it's like to see red, distinct from functional role or behavioral dispositions? Surely phenomenal character is real?

The debate between Wittgensteinian quietism and phenomenal realism remains unresolved. Your stance on inverted spectrum tracks your stance on private experience: real and irreducible, or grammatical confusion?

## where this leaves functionalism

If inverted spectrum is possible:

- Phenomenal properties don't reduce to functional properties
- Mental states aren't individuated purely functionally
- Consciousness is additional to causal structure
- [[thoughts/functionalism]] is false (or needs supplementation)

If inverted spectrum is impossible:

- Either phenomenal properties = functional properties (standard functionalism)
- Or phenomenology doesn't exist separately from function (eliminativism)
- Or phenomenology is necessarily tied to function (non-reductive functionalism with necessary connections)
- Or the whole question is confused (Wittgensteinian dissolution)

The argument has been around for centuries. Still no resolution. That itself is revealing: the question resists settlement because our concepts of function and phenomenology seem distinct, yet we have no clear account of their relationship.

Maybe that's where we are: stuck between intuition (qualia are real and independent of function) and theory (only functional properties figure in naturalistic explanation). The inverted spectrum makes the tension vivid. Doesn't resolve it.

---

So when you see red—are you having the same experience I have? Or something qualitatively different that we'll never know about? The inverted spectrum says: could be either. Function doesn't tell you. And if function doesn't tell you, functionalism doesn't capture everything about mind.
