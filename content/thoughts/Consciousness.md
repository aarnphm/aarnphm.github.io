some phenomena contains ontological subjectivity that emits [[thoughts/Epistemology|epistemological]] objectivity.

In a way, consciousness is the higher-level order system that the brain has _made up_, but consciousness is not any type of the features from the components of the brain. In a way, there is a mechanistic gaps between defining what consciousness is versus what is "actually there".

We can perform ==causal== [[thoughts/reductionism|reduction]] of consciousness to parts, but we can't ==[[thoughts/Ontology|ontologically]] reduce== consciousness because of subjective ontology

re on [materialist view of consciousness](https://aeon.co/essays/the-question-is-what-are-we-a-conversation-on-consciousness), what is the existence of free will?
