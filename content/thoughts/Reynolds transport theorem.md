Also known as _Leibniz-Reynolds transport therem_

A three-dimensional generalization of Leibniz integral rule

## general form

$$
\frac{d}{dt} \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f} dV = \int_{\Omega (t)} \frac{\partial{\mathbf{f}}}{\partial{t}} dV + \int_{\partial{\Omega (t)}}(\mathbf{v}_b \cdot \mathbf{n}) \mathbf{f} dA
$$

where:

- $\mathbf{n}(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the outward-pointing unit normal vector
- $\mathbf{x}$ is the variable of integrations
- $dV$ and $dA$ are volume and surface elements at $\mathbf{x}$
- $\mathbf{v}_b(\mathbf{x},t)$ is the velocity of the area element.
