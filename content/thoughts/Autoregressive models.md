A statistical model is autoregressive if it predicts future values based on past values. For example,
an autoregressive model might seek to predict a stockâ€™s future prices based on its past performance.

In context of LLMs, generative pre-trained [[thoughts/Transformers|transformers]] (GPTs) are derivations of
auto-regressive models where it takes an input sequence of tokens length $n$ and predicting the next token at index
$n+1$.

Auto-regressive models are often considered a more correct terminology when describing text-generation models.
