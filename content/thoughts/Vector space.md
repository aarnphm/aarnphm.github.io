Not to be confused with [[thoughts/Vector calculus#vector field]], but a vector space is a set whose vectors can be scaled by any given _scalars_

A vector space have all basic properties of a set, including associative, commutative, identity, inverse, distributivity

## coordinates, and subspace

We can then take a look for a set of $G$ of a $F$-vector space $V$, the following properties:

### linear combination

$a_{1} \mathbf{g}_1 + a_{2} \mathbf{g}_2 + \cdots + a_{n} \mathbf{g}_n$

where scalars $a_1, \ldots a_{n}$ is the _coefficient_ of the linear combination

### linear independent, span, basis, subspace
