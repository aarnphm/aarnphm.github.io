[[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] critiques the traditional approaches of [[thoughts/Will to Truth|truth]]. Nietzsche argues that philosophical thinking, like all conscious thinking, is driven by “instinctive” psychological forces, underneath which lie “valuations or, more clearly, physiological demands for the preservation of a certain type of life.”

What we really value is not truth, but survival, he says. He resists “accustomed value feelings,” and wants to go “beyond good and evil” (201)
