## workflow

- download statements from mit ocw; mirror in local `psets/` folder.
- log solution outlines and common pitfalls per set.
- file complete solutions externally; reference here for internal indexing only.

## links

- hub: [[thoughts/topology|topology hub]].
- supporting notes: [[thoughts/topology/point-set|point-set]], [[thoughts/topology/separation|separation]], [[thoughts/topology/compactness|compactness]], [[thoughts/topology/fundamental-group|fundamental group]].
