## objectives

- articulate loop concatenation, homotopy, and group structure with explicit examples.
- compute $\\pi_1$ for basic spaces (spheres, tori, projective plane, klein bottle) via van kampen.
- trace covering space classification theorems (lifting criteria, deck transformations).

## reading cues

- munkres ch. 51–56.
- mit 18.901 lectures 16–24, recitations on covering space problems.

## tasks

- [ ] derive van kampen for wedge sums and apply to bouquet of circles.
- [ ] work out covering spaces for circle, cylinder, mobius strip, torus.
- [ ] summarize relationship with group actions preparing for 18.906.
