## scope

- review $t_0$ through $t_4$ axioms with canonical examples and counterexamples.
- document urysohn lemma, tietze extension theorem, stone–cech teaser.
- connect metrization theorems (urysohn metrization, nagata-smirnov pointers) to mit 18.901 problem set 3.

## reading cues

- munkres ch. 16–22.
- mit 18.901 lecture notes weeks 4–5; note any differences between ocw and current 2025 delivery.

## tasks

- [ ] table of spaces classified by separation level (sierpinski, co-countable, indiscrete, plane with line collapsed).
- [ ] proof sketches for urysohn and tietze with annotations referencing textbook theorems 18.1–18.3.
- [ ] metrization theorem crib notes with hypotheses vs conclusions.
