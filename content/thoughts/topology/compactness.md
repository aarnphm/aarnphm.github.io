title: compactness and connectedness
---

## goals

- distill definitions: compact, sequentially compact, countably compact, lindelöf, locally compact.
- summarize connectedness, path-connectedness, components, local connectedness.
- catalogue mit 18.901 applications (heine-borel, tikhonov sketches, bounded continuous functions).

## reading cues

- munkres ch. 26–31.
- mit 18.901 lectures 12–15 (pset 5 focus).

## tasks

- [ ] prove equivalences between compactness notions in metric spaces (munkres 27.3).
- [ ] work through alexandroff one-point compactification examples.
- [ ] record connectedness counterexamples (topologist's sine curve, comb space).
