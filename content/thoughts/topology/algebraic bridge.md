## scope

{{sidenotes[phase 5-6]: this note covers phase 5 (weeks 13+) and extends into phase 6 (year 1 spring-summer) of the [[thoughts/topology/poincare-roadmap|poincaré roadmap]].}}

transition from fundamental group $\pi_1$ to homology theory $H_n$. develop computational tools for topological invariants essential for:

- [[thoughts/topology/simply-connected|understanding simple connectivity]] vs homological conditions
- [[thoughts/topology/3-manifolds|3-manifold topology]] (heegaard splittings, poincaré duality)
- prerequisites for [[thoughts/topology/differential-foundations|differential topology]]

## fundamental group recap

from [[thoughts/topology/fundamental-group|fundamental group]] phase:

- $\pi_1(X,x_0)$: homotopy classes of loops based at $x_0$
- seifert-van kampen theorem for computations
- covering space classification
- examples: $\pi_1(S^1) = \mathbb{Z}$, $\pi_1(T^2) = \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$

**limitation**: $\pi_1$ is non-abelian, difficult to compute for complex spaces.

homology provides abelian approximation with better computational properties.

## hurewicz connection

**hurewicz theorem**: for path-connected $X$,
$$H_1(X) \cong \pi_1(X)^{\text{ab}} = \pi_1(X)/[\pi_1(X),\pi_1(X)]$$

abelianization of fundamental group equals first homology.

**consequence**: $\pi_1 = 0 \Rightarrow H_1 = 0$, but converse fails.

see [[thoughts/topology/simply-connected#poincaré homology sphere|poincaré homology sphere]]: $H_1(\Sigma^3) = 0$ but $\pi_1(\Sigma^3) = I^*$ (order 120).

## homology theory foundations

### chain complexes

sequence of abelian groups with boundary maps:
$$\cdots \to C_{n+1} \xrightarrow{\partial_{n+1}} C_n \xrightarrow{\partial_n} C_{n-1} \to \cdots$$

satisfying $\partial_n \circ \partial_{n+1} = 0$ (boundary of boundary is zero).

**cycles**: $Z_n = \ker(\partial_n)$ (chains with no boundary)
**boundaries**: $B_n = \text{im}(\partial_{n+1})$ (chains that are boundaries)
**homology**: $H_n = Z_n / B_n$ (cycles modulo boundaries)

### singular homology

**singular $n$-simplex**: continuous map $\sigma: \Delta^n \to X$ from standard $n$-simplex.

**singular chain group**: $C_n(X) = $ free abelian group on singular $n$-simplices.

**boundary map**: $\partial_n: C_n \to C_{n-1}$ via alternating sum of face maps.

**singular homology**: $H_n(X) = \ker(\partial_n)/\text{im}(\partial_{n+1})$.

### simplicial homology

for spaces with triangulation (simplicial complexes):

- chain groups generated by $n$-simplices in triangulation
- boundary maps via combinatorial faces
- often easier to compute than singular homology
- **theorem**: for simplicial complexes, simplicial $\cong$ singular homology

### cellular homology

for cw complexes (spaces built by attaching cells):

- chain groups: $C_n^{CW} = H_n(X^n, X^{n-1})$ (relative homology of $n$-skeleton)
- boundary maps via attaching maps
- most efficient for computation
- **theorem**: cellular $\cong$ singular homology for cw complexes

## key theorems

### homotopy invariance

**theorem**: if $f \simeq g: X \to Y$ (homotopic maps), then $f_* = g_*: H_n(X) \to H_n(Y)$.

**corollary**: homotopy equivalent spaces have isomorphic homology.

### mayer-vietoris sequence

for $X = U \cup V$ with $U,V$ open:
$$\cdots \to H_n(U \cap V) \to H_n(U) \oplus H_n(V) \to H_n(X) \to H_{n-1}(U \cap V) \to \cdots$$

powerful computational tool via decomposition.

### poincaré duality

for closed oriented $n$-manifold $M^n$:
$$H_k(M) \cong H^{n-k}(M)$$

(homology in dimension $k$ isomorphic to cohomology in dimension $n-k$).

crucial for [[thoughts/topology/3-manifolds|3-manifold theory]].

### universal coefficient theorem

relates homology to cohomology:
$$0 \to \text{Ext}(H_{n-1}(X), G) \to H^n(X;G) \to \text{Hom}(H_n(X), G) \to 0$$

## computational examples

### spheres

$$H_n(S^k) = \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z} & n = 0, k \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

### torus

$$H_n(T^2) = \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z} & n = 0, 2 \\ \mathbb{Z}^2 & n = 1 \\ 0 & n \geq 3 \end{cases}$$

via mayer-vietoris on $T^2 = D_1 \cup D_2$ (two disks along boundaries).

### projective space

$$H_n(\mathbb{RP}^2) = \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z} & n = 0 \\ \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} & n = 1 \\ 0 & n \geq 2 \end{cases}$$

### poincaré homology sphere

$$H_n(\Sigma^3) = \begin{cases} \mathbb{Z} & n = 0, 3 \\ 0 & n = 1, 2 \end{cases}$$

same as $S^3$, but $\pi_1(\Sigma^3) = I^* \neq \{e\}$.

## cw complex examples

### sphere $S^n$

- one 0-cell (point)
- one $n$-cell attached via constant map

### torus $T^2$

- one 0-cell
- two 1-cells (meridian, longitude)
- one 2-cell attached via $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$

### projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$

- one 0-cell
- one 1-cell (loop)
- one 2-cell attached via $aa$ (double covering)

### klein bottle

- one 0-cell
- two 1-cells
- one 2-cell attached via $aba^{-1}b$

## tasks for mit 18.906 preparation

- [x] understand chain complexes and exact sequences
- [x] compute $H_*(S^n)$ using cellular homology
- [ ] work through mayer-vietoris for torus computation
- [ ] verify poincaré homology sphere has $H_1 = 0$
- [ ] construct cw complex structures for standard spaces
- [ ] practice long exact sequences of pairs
- [ ] understand universal coefficient theorem statement

## higher homotopy groups (preview)

beyond $\pi_1$ and homology, there are higher homotopy groups $\pi_n(X)$:
$$\pi_n(X,x_0) = [(S^n,s_0), (X,x_0)]$$

homotopy classes of based maps from $n$-sphere.

**properties**:

- $\pi_n$ is abelian for $n \geq 2$
- hurewicz connects to homology: $H_n(X) = \pi_n(X)$ for simply connected spaces (first non-trivial)
- very difficult to compute in general (e.g., $\pi_3(S^2) = \mathbb{Z}$ via hopf fibration)

not needed for poincaré conjecture, but important for higher topology.

## connection to poincaré roadmap

this phase (5-6) completes year 1 foundations:

- weeks 1-12: point-set + fundamental group ([[thoughts/topology|main hub]])
- weeks 13+: homology theory (this note)
- spring semester: mit 18.906 covering hatcher ch 2-3

**next steps**:

- year 2: [[thoughts/topology/differential-foundations|differential topology]] and [[thoughts/topology/3-manifolds|3-manifold theory]]
- understand why $\pi_1=0$ is the right condition for poincaré ([[thoughts/topology/simply-connected|simple connectivity]])

see [[thoughts/topology/poincare-roadmap|full roadmap]] for integration into 4-year plan.
