title: Brownian motion
---

The random motion of particles suspended in a medium (liquid or gas). uses _Wiener process_ to form mathematical model

this pattern is used to describe a fluid at thermal equilibrium.

## einstein theory

- formulation of a diffusion equations for Brownian particles.
  - correlated to _mean squared displacement_ of Brownian particles
- relation diffusion coefficient to measurable physical quantities
