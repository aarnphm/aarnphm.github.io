> A window into the ideas that frames ideas that people are prepared to entertain. All ideas outside the window are not seriously considered.

More prominent in the land of policy-making, but also apply to general idea perception.

To move the window requires people, ideas outside of the window to shift what is considered "generally" acceptable by the public.
