TLDR: Most algorithm determine importance through aggregating attentions over observed queries [@zhang2023h2oheavyhitteroracleefficient; @liu2023scissorhandsexploitingpersistenceimportance]

More recent work aggregated attention from _limited observation windows_ [@li2024snapkvllmknowslooking; @cai2024pyramidkvdynamickvcache]

uses top_k to find $k$-indices of attentions per head to preserve, and evict the not-so-important ones.

Another techniques to work with KV is to offload to a central storage, to then reuse in other context.

## KV-cache layout

NHD/HND

- `NHD` -> `(seq_len, num_heads, head_dim)`
- `HND` -> `(num_heads, seq_len, head_dim)`

## idea.

Look at past attention weights for each pair of key and value vectors
(a measure of the degree with which that KVâ€™s representation has been queried during past attention operations)

Then select the KV with the least attention to evict

Think of LFU (least frequency used) cache management policy

the KV cache for each sequence in a particular layer is allocated on the GPU as a _# attention heads $X$ sequence length_ tensor.

> total memory allocation scales with the _maximum_ sequence length for all attention heads of the KV cache

_Using attention sink_

Ablate attentions among layers that deemed to be less valuable to current generations.

Voting: calculating attention weights for each query within observation windows across all attention heads, then aggregate to highlight prefix positions. Formally for a single batch:

$$
\begin{aligned}
C = &\sum_{i=0}^{L_{\text{obs}}} W_{\text{obs}} [:,i,:] \\
I &= \text{Top}_{k}(C, k)
\end{aligned}
$$

> $k$ is defined as $\lfloor p \times L_{\text{prefix}} \rfloor$, where $p$ is the compression rates.

Hit Rate: essentially the attention features above a predefined threshold $\Theta$ to be ==important== features.

The idea is to have two stages:

- **Vote for important features**: select important features based on important features given fixed windows.
- **Update and store the compressed KV**: concat attention features within the windows and update the KV-cache.

- clustering via pooling => frequent hit-rate attention
  ```python
  attn_cache = pool1d(attn_weights_sum, kernel_size=kernel_size, padding=kernel_size // 2, stride=1)
  ```

## Ada-KV

ideas: instead of uniform eviction for KV cache hit, allocate a certain budget $B_i$ per attention heads to dynamically evict certain heads
