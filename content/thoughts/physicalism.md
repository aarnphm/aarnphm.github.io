_physicalism holds 51.9% of professional philosophers (philpapers 2020), a slim majority position._

the thesis: everything that exists is physical, or at minimum supervenes on the physical. mental properties depend on physical properties in a way that makes changing the mental impossible without changing the physical.

## what the claim actually is

technical version: no change in mental properties without corresponding change in physical properties. this is stronger than correlation, it's dependence. the physical determines the mental.

jackson's (1998) clean formulation: physicalism is true iff any world physically identical to ours is identical period. this makes it about determination, not vocabulary. you could use mental terms forever and still be a physicalist as long as mental facts are fixed by physical facts.

## variants

### type identity theory (the strong version)

place (1956), feigl (1958), smart (1959) said: mental state types are identical to brain state types. pain = c-fiber firing. no extra mental properties, just one thing with two descriptions.

smart's argument was parsimony: if identity theory explains everything [[thoughts/dualism]] explains using one kind of thing instead of two, prefer identity theory. theoretical economy counts.

place introduced "the phenomenological fallacy": the mistake of thinking that when you describe your experience of red, you're describing intrinsic properties of some internal red object. (you're actually describing properties of the external thing you're perceiving.)

### token identity theory (weaker, more flexible)

every particular mental event is identical to some particular physical event, but mental TYPES don't have to map to physical TYPES. this handles multiple realizability: pain in humans, octopi, aliens realized by different substrates while still being pain.

davidson's anomalous monism (1970): mental events ARE physical events, yet there are no strict psychophysical laws. the mental is "anomalous," it resists lawlike capture. [@davidson1970mentalevents]

### eliminative materialism (the aggressive move)

paul and patricia churchland (1981, 1986): folk psychology (belief, desire, intention) is a failed theory destined for elimination, not reduction. [@churchland1981eliminative]

their case: folk psychology is stagnant, explains nothing about dreams, mental illness, creativity, memory. neuroscience will replace belief/desire talk with neural population dynamics.

the fundamental unit isn't "believes that P," it's activation patterns. this is physicalism at maximum aggression: deny that mental states as commonly understood exist.

## supervenience

davidson (1970) brought this into phil mind: "mental characteristics are in some sense dependent, or supervenient, on physical characteristics."

kim sorted out the variants:

- **weak**: within a world, mental duplicates are physical duplicates
- **strong**: across all possible worlds, physical duplicates are mental duplicates
- **global**: no two worlds can be physically identical while mentally different

kim's important point: supervenience describes a pattern, it doesn't explain anything. it gestures toward some underlying story (identity, realization, emergence) but doesn't tell you which one. [@kim1993supervenience]

## why people accept physicalism

### causal closure (the main lever)

papineau's argument:

1. every physical effect has a sufficient physical cause (conservation laws, physics works)
2. mental events cause physical events (your decision moves your arm)
3. therefore mental events must be physical events (otherwise overdetermination everywhere)

historical roots: leibniz's momentum conservation, helmholtz's energy conservation.

### empirical track record

reductive programs keep succeeding: heat = molecular kinetic energy, lightning = electrical discharge. betting consciousness will follow the pattern.

### parsimony

smart: if physicalism explains everything [[thoughts/dualism]] explains using one ontological category instead of two, prefer physicalism. theoretical economy matters.

## arguments against physicalism

### the knowledge argument

jackson (1982, 1986): mary's room. mary knows all physical facts about color vision while trapped in a black-and-white room. upon release, she learns what red looks like. if she learns a new fact, physicalism is false. [@jackson1982epiphenomenalqualia]

jackson later recanted (now calls himself a physicalist), though he still considers the argument serious.

responses:

- **ability hypothesis** (lewis, nemirow): mary gains know-how, not know-that
- **acquaintance hypothesis** (conee): mary becomes acquainted with a property she already knew about
- **new mode of presentation** (horgan): same fact, different representational format

### conceivability arguments

chalmers (1996): [[thoughts/philosophical zombies]]. beings physically identical to us but lacking consciousness. [@chalmers1996consciousmind]

1. zombies are conceivable (no contradiction in the concept)
2. what's conceivable is metaphysically possible
3. if zombies are possible, consciousness isn't necessitated by physics
4. ergo physicalism is false

responses:

- deny conceivability implies possibility (strong necessities exist, a la kripke)
- deny zombies are genuinely conceivable (dennett: the concept is incoherent)

2020 survey: 36% say conceivable but impossible, 23% say possible, 16% say inconceivable.

### the explanatory gap

levine (1983, 1993, 2001): even if consciousness is physical, we can't explain why these physical processes give rise to experience. knowing c-fibers fire doesn't tell you why it hurts. [@levine1983gap]

levine himself is physicalist-agnostic. considers this possibly just epistemic, not ontological. distinction from chalmers' "hard problem": gap might be about our cognitive limitations, not metaphysical facts.

### multiple realizability

putnam (1967): pain in humans, octopi, and hypothetical aliens likely realized by different physical substrates. ergo pain can't be identical to c-fiber firing (type identity fails). [@putnam1967mentalstates]

primarily an objection to type identity, compatible with token identity and [[thoughts/functionalism]]. some recent pushback (polger & shapiro 2016): burden of proof should be on multiple realizability claims.

## connection to functionalism

[[thoughts/functionalism]] provides a supervenience base for non-reductive physicalism:

- mental states are defined by their FUNCTIONAL ROLE, their causal relations to inputs, outputs, and other mental states
- the physical provides the substrate that realizes these functional roles
- multiple realizability is a feature: what matters is the functional organization, not the specific physical implementation

putnam's later critique (1988): mental kinds are multiply realizable over functional kinds too. the same mental state can be implemented by different computational states. this threatens functionalism's explanatory power.

chalmers' fading [[thoughts/qualia]] thought experiment: if you gradually replace neurons with functionally equivalent silicon chips, does consciousness fade. functionalists say no, if causal roles preserved, consciousness preserved.

## implications for AI (where the stakes get practical)

if physicalism is true, consciousness depends on physical organization. replicate the relevant organization (or its functional equivalent) and you replicate consciousness. substrate independence becomes empirical, not principled.

if [[thoughts/functionalism]] is the right version, consciousness is substrate-independent. implement the right functional organization and you get consciousness. silicon minds become possible in principle.

if biological naturalism (searle) is right, consciousness requires specific causal powers of biological neurons. silicon can't do it, even with identical function. the chinese room supports this.

practical upshot: physicalism makes AI consciousness possible. denying physicalism makes it mysterious or impossible. functionalist physicalism makes it tractable given sufficient functional replication.
