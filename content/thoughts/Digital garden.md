A collection of notes, thoughts, and ideas that are cultivated and grown over time. It's a place where you can plant seeds, grow them, and let them bloom. It's a place where you can let your thoughts grow organically, and where you can let your ideas flourish.

In a sense, it is a form of [[thoughts/Hypertext|hypertext]], a personalized Xanadu system.
