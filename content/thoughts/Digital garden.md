A collection of notes, thoughts, and ideas that are cultivated and grown over time. It's a place where you can plant seeds, grow them, and let them bloom. It's a place where you can let your thoughts grow organically, and where you can let your ideas flourish.

In a sense, it is a form of [[thoughts/Hypertext|hypertext]], a personalized Xanadu system. Wikipedia is also considered as society's digital garden

Joel Hooks puts this better than I can ever do:

> A garden is usually a place where things grow.
>
> Gardens can be very personal and full of whimsy or a garden can be a source of food and substance.
>
> We gather and work together in community gardens to share the labor as well as the rewards of a collective effort.
>
> It's a comparison that you can take very far. From "planting seeds" and "pulling weeds" to tending multiple gardens that each serve an individual need or desired outcome.
>
> Like with real gardens, our digital gardens are a constant ebb and flow towards [[thoughts/Entropy|entropy]].

## The garden and the stream

> I don’t want people to get hung up on the technology angle. I think sometimes people hear “Federated Thingamabob” and just sort of tune out thinking “Oh, he’s talking about a feature of Federated Thingamabob.” But I’m not. I’m really not. I’m talking about a different way to think your online activity, no matter what tool you use. And relevant to this conference, I’m talking about a different way of collaborating as well.
