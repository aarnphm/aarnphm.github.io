> Imagine you're learning to recognize dogs. At first, your parents point to different dogs and say "that's a dog!" After seeing lots of dogs, you start noticing patterns - they have four legs, fur, tails, and make barking sounds. Now you can spot dogs on your own!

> Deep learning works kind of like that, but for computers. The computer looks at tons of pictures (like thousands and thousands), and slowly figures out what makes a dog look like a dog. It starts with simple things like edges and shapes, then builds up to more complicated stuff like spotting ears, tails, and finally whole dogs.

Deep learning is a superset of [[thoughts/Machine learning]]. [[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-4ml3|Supervised]] and un-supervised refers to the training objective within machine learning, rather than
the goal of different algorithms.
