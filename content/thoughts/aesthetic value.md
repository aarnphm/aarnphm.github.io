title: aesthetic value
---

Related to but distinct from [[thoughts/taste|taste]] (capacity for aesthetic judgment) and beauty (one type of aesthetic value among others).

[[thoughts/Philosophy and Kant|Kant]], [[thoughts/Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] are somewhat relevant, but they operated on different value plane.

## core questions

the field splits on five fault lines:

- what makes aesthetic value _aesthetic_ rather than moral, epistemic, or prudential?
- what makes aesthetic value _valuable_—intrinsic worth or derivative utility?
- are aesthetic values objective features or response-dependent relations?
- one fundamental aesthetic value (beauty) or irreducible plurality (sublimity, elegance, grace)?
- does aesthetic experience reveal pre-existing value or constitute it?

Running theory: fitting attitude theories, response-dependence accounts, and value pluralism contest the terrain.

## relationships

aesthetic value sits among:

- moral value (rightness, virtue, duty)
- [[thoughts/Epistemology|epistemic]] value (knowledge, justified belief, understanding)
- prudential value (well-being, good-for, welfare)
- economic value (utility, preference-satisfaction)

> [!note] Value pluralism

> _(Berlin, Williams)_
>
> these are irreducibly distinct, potentially incommensurable. No common scale ranks aesthetic against moral value. Conflicts between value types may have no determinate resolution—not epistemic limitation but metaphysical fact.

## theories of aesthetic value

- [[#aesthetic hedonism|hedonism]]
- [[#fitting attitude theories]]
- [[#network theory]]
- [[#primitivism about aesthetic value]]

### aesthetic hedonism

aesthetic value derives from pleasure. beautiful objects are those productive of aesthetic pleasure; sublime experiences valuable for complex pleasure-pain dynamics.

challenge: not all aesthetic value is pleasurable. tragic art, disturbing performances, difficult music—aesthetically valuable yet painful. the sublime involves discomfort. horror genre trades on unpleasant affect.

sophisticated hedonism: distinguish aesthetic pleasure (contemplative, disinterested) from bodily pleasure. but this smuggles in non-hedonic criteria—what makes pleasure _aesthetic_ if not its object's formal properties?

### fitting attitude theories

something has aesthetic value if it _merits_ particular responses—admiration, contemplation, delight [@scanlon1998what]. value explained through normative facts about appropriate attitudes rather than natural properties.

- beautiful objects merit contemplative appreciation
- sublime experiences merit awe and wonder
- elegant solutions merit intellectual admiration

"wrong kind of reasons" problem: demon threatens you unless you admire mud. the threat gives reason to admire but doesn't make mud admirable. responses distinguish _right_ vs _wrong_ kind of reasons—only reasons bearing on object's features confer value, not external incentives.

fitting attitudes offer middle ground between crude subjectivism (anything anyone likes is valuable) and mysterious objectivism (values as queer non-natural properties).

### network theory

value emerges from successful performance within social practices. aesthetic value constituted by communal practices of art-making, criticism, appreciation.

emphasizes institutional and cultural dimensions. what counts as valuable shifts across practices—western classical music vs gamelan, renaissance painting vs contemporary installation.

challenge: seems too relativistic. can practices themselves be criticized? or does this collapse to "whatever the practice says is valuable, is valuable"?

### primitivism about aesthetic value

aesthetic value is sui generis, irreducible, fundamental. cannot be analyzed in terms of pleasure, fitting attitudes, or social practices [@moore1903principia].

moore's influence: goodness (including aesthetic goodness) is simple, unanalyzable property. attempts to define it commit naturalistic fallacy.

cost: explanatory sterility. "why is this beautiful?" "it just has the property of beauty." question-begging.

benefit: respects phenomenology. aesthetic value feels primitive, not derivative.

## [[thoughts/Metaphysics|metaphysical]] foundations

### realism vs anti-realism

**realism:** values exist independently of human responses. aesthetic properties are objective features objects genuinely {{sidenotes[possess.]: mackie's challenge: values would be "metaphysically queer"—objectively prescriptive, motivating by their mere apprehension. would require special faculty of aesthetic perception. "to-be-appreciated-ness somehow built into" the property [@mackie1977ethics].}}

**anti-realism:** values constituted by (ideal) responses. nothing is beautiful apart from its capacity to produce certain experiences in appropriately sensitive {{sidenotes[perceivers.]: challenge: explaining normativity. if beauty just is whatever produces pleasure in ideal observers, why should non-ideal observers care? why does "this is beautiful" make normative claim on us?}}

### response-dependence

values are objective yet relationally constituted—determined by responses under ideal conditions.

> x is beautiful iff x would produce aesthetic pleasure in ideal observers under ideal {{sidenotes[conditions.]: adequate perception, no distorting factors, appropriate background knowledge.}}

values aren't "in the head" (pure subjectivism) but aren't "in the world" independent of perceivers (robust realism). they're _dispositional_—real relations between objects and (idealized) subjects. [@nehamas2007promise]

### supervenience

aesthetic properties necessarily depend on non-aesthetic properties. no aesthetic difference without some non-aesthetic difference.

two paintings can't differ in beauty unless they differ in color, composition, brushwork, subject matter. aesthetic supervenes on non-aesthetic.

challenge for non-naturalism: explaining this dependence without reduction. if beauty is non-natural property, why does it _always_ come packaged with particular natural properties?

## historical positions

### [[thoughts/Philosophy and Kant|Kant]]

_(1724-1804)_

beauty: disinterested pleasure claiming universal validity [@kant1790critique].

"disinterested": not based on desire or utility. aesthetic contemplation brackets practical interests—don't ask "can i eat this?" or "will it sell?" just perceive form.

"subjective universality": judgment grounded in pleasure (subjective) yet claims validity for all (universal). "ought to agree" without invoking concepts or rules.

free play between imagination and understanding. imagination synthesizes sensory manifold; understanding seeks concepts. in aesthetic experience they harmonize without determining concept—pleasurable cognitive activity.

sublime: reason's superiority over nature. mathematically sublime (magnitude overwhelming imagination) vs dynamically sublime (might that reason grasps as inferior to moral law).

aesthetic as bridge between nature and freedom, symbol of morality.

### Hume

_(1711-1776)_

"truth is disputable; not taste"—initial subjectivism [@hume1757standard]. but hume pulls back: standard of taste through _qualified judges_.

qualified judges have:

- delicacy of imagination (refined sensibility to subtle qualities)
- practice (extensive experience with relevant art forms)
- comparison (exposure to variety of styles, periods, cultures)
- freedom from prejudice (overcome personal biases)
- good sense (general intelligence, insight)

sophisticated position between relativism and absolute standards. values are response-dependent but not arbitrary—structured by facts about ideal observers.

### Schopenhauer

_(1788-1860)_

aesthetic contemplation as escape from will. ordinary experience enslaved to desire, suffering, striving. aesthetic experience achieves "will-less perception"—temporary liberation.

reveals platonic ideas: essential, universal features directly perceived. art presents ideas more clearly than nature—artist distills essence.

hierarchy of arts based on will's objectification: architecture (lowest) → sculpture → painting → poetry → music (highest). music doesn't represent ideas—directly expresses will itself.

beauty = easy aesthetic contemplation, tranquility. sublime = difficult aesthetic contemplation, will momentarily overwhelmed before reasserting itself.

### [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]

_(1844-1900)_

rejects disinterested aesthetic appreciation. focus on artist's creative experience, not spectator's passive reception.

"aesthetics is applied physiology"—embodied, life-affirming activity. apollonian (form, order, representation, dream) vs dionysian (expression, chaos, non-representation, intoxication).

aesthetic justification of existence: "only as aesthetic phenomenon is existence and the world eternally justified." not moral justification—aesthetic.

art as life-affirmation. "we have art so that we do not perish from the truth." truth is terrible; art makes life bearable by beautifying, transforming, redeeming.

### Dewey

_(1859-1952)_

art as experience: dynamic temporal process with rhythm, development, consummation [@dewey1934art].

continuity between aesthetic and ordinary experience. aesthetic qualities emerge in practical and intellectual activities—mechanic finding elegant solution, scientist appreciating theory's beauty.

rejects "museum conception" placing art on "remote pedestal." art serves life—expanding perception, enriching experience, facilitating growth.

pragmatist criterion: values art for consequences. but aesthetic experience valuable in itself _and_ instrumentally—not contradiction but recognition that intrinsic and extrinsic value coexist.

### Collingwood

_(1889-1943)_

art as expression of emotion (expressionist theory) [@collingwood1938principles].

expression ≠ arousal or description. expression = becoming conscious of emotion through creative articulation. imagination transforms inchoate feelings into conscious experiences.

art vs craft: craft has predetermined end (make chair, build house), planned execution. art spontaneous, end discovered through process. artist doesn't know what emotion will be expressed until expressing it.

value in authentic emotional expression. fake art (commercial entertainment, propaganda) manipulates emotion without genuine expression.

## debates

There are some arguments between [[#objectivity and normativity]] and [[#value pluralism and incommensurability]]

### objectivity and normativity

aesthetic judgments claim correctness beyond individual preference. "this is beautiful" asserts more than "i like this"—makes normative claim.

yet grounded in subjective responses. no aesthetic perception without pleasure/displeasure, emotional engagement, phenomenal character.

fitting attitudes, response-dependence, ideal observer theories attempt reconciliation. objectivity through normative facts about appropriate responses or idealized convergence.

### aesthetic testimony

can aesthetic judgments be transmitted through testimony?

acquaintance principle: aesthetic judgments must be based on first-hand perceptual experience. can't know painting is beautiful merely on others' say-so—must see it yourself [@nguyen2020].

aesthetic autonomy: forming own judgments vs deferring to experts. testimony threatens autonomy—passive reception vs active engagement.

implications for aesthetic epistemology: if testimony blocked, how do we learn aesthetic truths? trial and error? cultivation of sensibility?

### value pluralism and incommensurability

multiple irreducible aesthetic values: beauty, sublimity, elegance, grace, balance, unity, intensity, delicacy, power.

incommensurability: values not comparable on common scale. can't reduce all aesthetic worth to single metric. ranking all artworks by unified standard "foolish, boring, stultifying."

genuine conflicts without determinate resolution. beautiful vs powerful, elegant vs intense—may conflict without one being correct answer.

### aesthetic vs non-aesthetic properties

aesthetic {{sidenotes[properties]: sibley: aesthetic concepts aren't condition-governed [@sibley1959aesthetic]. no rules: "if it has properties F, G, H, then it's graceful." requires taste—perceptual sensitivity plus conceptual understanding}} supervene on non-aesthetic properties (form, color, sound, movement). but relationship isn't reduction.

## intrinsic vs extrinsic

**intrinsic:** valuable in itself, for its own sake. moore's isolation test—would it be good even if it existed alone in universe?

**extrinsic:**

- _instrumental_: valuable as means to other goods
- _contributory_: valuable as part of larger valuable whole
- _final_: valued as end, not means (overlaps with intrinsic)

traditional view: aesthetic contemplation valued for own sake (intrinsic). dewey: aesthetic experience valuable for life-enhancement (both intrinsic and instrumental).

## beauty vs aesthetic value

beauty is _one_ aesthetic value among others. sublimity, elegance, grace, balance, unity—all aesthetic values not reducible to beauty.

historical dominance of beauty reflects bias, not metaphysical necessity. contemporary aesthetics pluralistic about values. [@zangwill2001metaphysics; @nehamas2007promise]

## subjective vs objective

crude subjectivism: beauty is whatever anyone finds pleasant. problems: no disagreement possible, no normativity, no learning.

crude objectivism: beauty is natural property objects possess. problems: mackie's queerness objection, explaining response-dependence intuitions.

sophisticated positions: response-dependence (objective yet constituted by ideal responses), fitting attitudes (objective normative facts about merited responses), Kant's subjective universality (subjective basis, objective claim).
