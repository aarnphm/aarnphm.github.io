IPFS is a decentralized storage and delivery networks which built on top of [[thoughts/p2p]] networking and content-based addressing (CID).

> Can be seen in [[thoughts/git]] repositories, BitTorent, and most recently Ethereum.

Similar to how we can reference an URI, we can look up its content by [[thoughts/Content-addressable storage|content-address]]

How would we use IPFS to share and publish data?
