### Engine

A search engine is essentially query processing. It is a form of [[thoughts/information retrieval]] that helps one to answer [[thoughts/questions]]

The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as search engine results pages (SERPs).

Some search engines also mine [[thoughts/data]] available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories, which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler.

For example a search query for keyword "machine learning":

```prolog
[]: # (END)
[]: # Path: content/thoughts/AGI.md
[]: # ---
[]: # id: AGI
[]: # tags:
[]: #   - seed
[]: # date: "2024-02-07"
[]: # title: AGI
[]: # ---
[]: #
[]: # The proposal is that such an AGI would be able to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. It would also be able to learn and improve itself, and possibly be able to do things that humans cannot do.
[]: #
[]: # We saw "some sparks" in [[thoughts/LLMs]] that it can "understand" [[thoughts/NLP|natural language]]
