## Engine

A search engine is essentially query processing. It is a form of [[thoughts/information retrieval]] that helps one to answer [[thoughts/questions]]

The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as search engine results pages (SERPs).

Some search engines also mine [[thoughts/data]] available in databases or open directories. Unlike web directories, which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintain real-time information by running an algorithm on a web crawler.
