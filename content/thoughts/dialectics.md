### Hegel's dialectics

The opposing sides are dependant of the topics being discussed.

In [[library/The Phenomenology of Spirit]], Hegel presents his idea of [[thoughts/Epistemology|epistemology]], the "opposing sides" are different definitions of consciousness and of the object that consciousness is aware of or claims to know.

In his work in [[thoughts/logic|logic]], the opposing sides are logical concepts that are opposed to one another.
