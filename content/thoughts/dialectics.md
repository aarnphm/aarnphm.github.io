### [[thoughts/Hegel|Hegel]]'s dialectics

The opposing sides are dependant of the topics being discussed.

In [[thoughts/Hegel#Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]] which presents his [[thoughts/Epistemology|epistemology]], the "opposing sides" are different definitions of consciousness and of the object that consciousness is aware of or claims to know.

In his work in [[thoughts/logic|logic]], the opposing sides are logical concepts that are opposed to one another.
