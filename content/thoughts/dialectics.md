often involves some sort of contradictory between opposing sides.

### [[thoughts/Hegel]]'s dialectics

The opposing sides are dependant of the topics being discussed.

In [[thoughts/Hegel#Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of Spirit]] which presents his [[thoughts/Epistemology]], the "opposing sides" are different definitions of consciousness and of the object that consciousness is aware of or claims to know.

In his work in _logic_, the opposing sides are logical concepts that are opposed to one another.
