> The ability and freedom to [[thoughts/action theory|act]] in their immediate environment.

> Everyone talks about having agency, but when it comes to falling in love, we have none (that's why it is called falling)

[[thoughts/Chaos|Chaos]] allows for agency, but too much [[thoughts/Entropy|entropy]] can create problems.

> Their way of appropriating the world was fundamentally different from mine: everything around them was something they could take apart and put back together. If they didn’t like how the light fell in their living room, they moved the windows. If they needed a lathe, they disassembled a hammer drill and turned it into a lathe. Their world was filled with affordances that I didn’t see. Where I saw a sweater, she saw a thread temporarily shaped as one—it could just as well be a scarf, a pair of socks, a hat, or six gloves. She saw more degrees of freedom than I did, and acted on it.
