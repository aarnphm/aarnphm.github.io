A set of points described by a dynamical system.

Some exhibits [[thoughts/Chaos|chaotic]] behaviour, see also [Paul Bourke's work](https://paulbourke.net/fractals/)

Often create visually appealing patterns, but its applications range from physics to biology: how we understand weather patterns, bird migration patterns, quantum phenomena.
