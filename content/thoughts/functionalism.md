title: functionalism
---

Functionalism frames mental kinds as relational patterns inside a causal-computational architecture; individuation depends on the role that links inputs, inter-level transitions, and outputs rather than on substrate-specific chemistry. [@levin2024functionalism] The view retains the explanatory bite of [[thoughts/identity|type-identity theory]] while preserving the empirical humility of [[thoughts/Behavirourism|behaviourism]], and it scales across nervous tissue, synthetic controllers, and commoditised inference engines like [[thoughts/LLMs]].

## Invariants

- **Role individuation.** Mental types are fixed by second-order descriptions over lower-level realizers; any realizer that satisfies the role inherits the type. [@levin2024functionalism]
- **Multiple realization with structural constraints.** Putnam-style arguments license heterogenous implementations, yet serious models now enforce functional isomorphisms—Markov blankets, generative policies, or control-theoretic invariants—so that realizations remain dynamically equivalent. [@parr2018computationalneuropsychology]
- **Normative anchoring.** Bayesian and predictive-control functionalism makes rationality, precision-weighting, and error dynamics constitutive of mentality, not merely observable regularities. [@friston2017computationalnosology]

> [!example] Computational hermeneutics
> Higher-order logics model concept possession as the ability to execute typed transformations among meaning-constraints; the functional role is literally a proof-term that mediates interpretation across agents. [@fuenmayor2019computationalhermeneutic]

## Variants

- **Machine-state functionalism.** Classical automata models capture mental descriptions via machine tables and treat realizer choice as an engineering problem. [@levin2024functionalism]
- **Psycho-functionalism.** Empirical cognitive science supplies the base theory of internal states, letting laboratory constraints determine which roles matter. [@levin2024functionalism]
- **Predictive functionalism.** Active inference and hierarchical Bayesian schemes treat minds as precision-tuned generative controllers; functional profiles are prior/posterior update operators. [@parr2018computationalneuropsychology]
- **Teleosemantic precision psychiatry.** Clinical functionalism ties mental categories to normatively optimal control of physiological and social niches, embedding value and error statistics inside the role description. [@friston2017computationalnosology]
- **Autopoietic functionalism.** Systems qualify as minded when their functional organization maintains self-producing Markov blankets that couple internal dynamics to niche signals. [@allen2018autopoiesis]

## Critique vectors

Kantian worries stress that purely functional individuation may collapse into regulative schemas that presuppose, rather than ground, phenomenal unity, exposing functionalism to transcendental circularity. [@mccormick2003kantfunctionalism] Embodied cognition and enactivist programs argue that if function is divorced from constitutive sensorimotor participation, the theory re-imports disembodied symbol manipulation under new names; autopoietic refinements try to absorb this pressure by baking bodily viability into the role itself. [@allen2018autopoiesis]

> [!warning] Qualia deficit
> Functional duplicates risk diverging over first-person givenness unless role-specifications incorporate phenomenal invariants, a point that keeps modal arguments against functionalism alive in contemporary debates. [@mccormick2003kantfunctionalism]

## Deployment notes

Functional individuation underwrites inference stacks from [[thoughts/Mechanistic interpretability|mechanistic interpretability]] to precision psychiatry: it licenses replacing biological microphysics with executable role analogues so long as error-driven updating, controllability, and self-maintenance are conserved. [@friston2017computationalnosology] Treat this as an engineering thesis about what has to stay fixed when we port cognition across media.
