Mental states are job descriptions. Pain, belief, attention—each defined by what it does, not what it's made of. If something takes the right inputs, updates correctly, and produces the right outputs, it counts as that mental state. Neurons, transistors, code: irrelevant. [@levin2024functionalism] retains the explanatory bite of [[thoughts/identity|type-identity theory]] while preserving the empirical humility of [[thoughts/Behavirourism|behaviourism]], and it scales across nervous tissue, synthetic controllers, and commoditised inference engines like [[thoughts/LLMs]].

## invariants

- **Role individuation.** A mental state is whatever plays its causal role. Two systems that respond identically to inputs, handle errors the same way, and produce matching outputs count as the same mental kind—regardless of implementation. [@levin2024functionalism]
- **Multiple realization with structural constraints.** Same role, different tools—but not _any_ tools. Brains and chips can both "recognize faces" if their error correction, update dynamics, and boundary maintenance match. Substrate varies; structure must align. [@parr2018computationalneuropsychology]
- **Normative anchoring.** Bayesian and predictive-control functionalism makes rationality, precision-weighting, and error dynamics constitutive of mentality, not merely observable regularities. [@friston2017computationalnosology]
- **Empirical validation via mechanistic interpretability.** Sparse autoencoders discover functional roles in neural networks by decomposing activations into causally-individuated features. Ablation studies test whether features play their hypothesized roles across architectures—validating multiple realization. [@geiger2025causalabstraction]

> [!example] Computational hermeneutics
> Understanding = ability to transform meanings correctly. A concept is a rule for moving between language-games. Proof-terms make the rule explicit. [@fuenmayor2019computationalhermeneutic]

## variants

- **Machine-state functionalism.** Mental states = rows in a state transition table. Input + current state → output + next state. Thermostat, computer, brain—same formalism. Implementation is engineering, not metaphysics. [@levin2024functionalism]
- **Analytic functionalism.** Conceptual/semantic analysis fixes a role via Ramsey-Lewis definitions; mental terms are defined by their place in a commonsense/folk-psychology network. [@levin2024functionalism]
- **Psycho-functionalism.** Empirical cognitive science supplies the base theory of internal states, letting laboratory constraints determine which roles matter. [@levin2024functionalism]
- **Role vs realizer functionalism.** Role functionalism identifies mental kinds with second-order roles; realizer functionalism identifies them with whatever first-order state realizes that role in a system—distinct carving of kinds with practical consequences. [@levin2024functionalism]
- **Homuncular functionalism.** Decompose a complex role into simpler sub-roles executed by “dumber” subsystems; explanation improves by functional factorization.
- **Predictive functionalism.** Active inference and hierarchical Bayesian schemes treat minds as precision-tuned generative controllers; functional profiles are prior/posterior update operators. [@parr2018computationalneuropsychology]
- **Teleosemantic precision psychiatry.** Clinical functionalism ties mental categories to normatively optimal control of physiological and social niches, embedding value and error statistics inside the role description. [@friston2017computationalnosology]
- **Autopoietic functionalism.** Systems qualify as minded when their functional organization maintains self-producing Markov blankets that couple internal dynamics to niche signals. [@allen2018autopoiesis]
- **Computational infrastructure functionalism.** Serving systems ([[thoughts/vllm]], TensorRT-LLM) implement substrate independence: paged vs contiguous memory, variable compression rates, continuous vs static batching—all preserve functional equivalence (same input → same output distribution) while varying implementation.

## critique

Kantian objection: functionalism assumes a unified subject to individuate roles, but roles are supposed to _define_ what a subject is. You need the thing you're trying to explain. Circular. [@mccormick2003kantfunctionalism] Embodied cognition and enactivist programs argue that if function is divorced from constitutive sensorimotor participation, the theory re-imports disembodied symbol manipulation under new names; autopoietic refinements try to absorb this pressure by baking bodily viability into the role itself. [@allen2018autopoiesis]

Energy and timing constraints challenge pure substrate independence: real computation depends on energy, which depends on material substrates. Functional roles must specify energy budgets and temporal dynamics—a 10ms biological response vs 100ms silicon response may break functional equivalence in real-time control loops. [@thagard2021energyrequirements]

> Functional duplicates risk diverging over first-person givenness unless role-specifications incorporate phenomenal invariants, a point that keeps modal arguments against functionalism alive in contemporary debates. [@mccormick2003kantfunctionalism]

### objections

- absent qualia: a system could have the right role without any feel at all; functional equivalence does not force phenomenality. [wiki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(philosophy_of_mind)>)
- inverted qualia: same role, different qualia mapping (your red = my green) with no functional difference; role underdetermines phenomenology. [@shoemaker1982invertedspectrum] [wiki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(philosophy_of_mind)>)
- china brain: a nation-simulated controller could realize the role; does that entail consciousness? if not, role ≠ mind. [@block1978troublesfunctionalism] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room#The_Chinese_Nation_and_the_Chinese_Room)
- chinese room: pure symbol-shuffling can pass functional tests without understanding; syntax isn’t semantics. [@searle1980minds] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room)
- knowledge argument: mary learns a new fact (what-red-is-like) despite knowing all functional/physical facts; functional story is not complete. [@jackson1982epiphenomenalqualia; @jackson1986whatmary] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argument)
- zombies: functional duplicates without experience are conceivable; if metaphysically possible, functionalism misses something. [@chalmers1996consciousmind] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie)
- liberalism vs chauvinism: unrefined role specs risk over-inclusion (thermostats “believe”) or over-exclusion (alien silicon minds). [wiki](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(philosophy_of_mind)>)

### sep critiques

- qualia underdetermination: absent/inverted qualia show second-order role specs don’t fix phenomenal character. [@levin2024functionalism]
- triviality/disjunction worry: overly permissive role descriptions become gerrymandered disjunctions that any complex system satisfies, draining explanatory power. [@levin2024functionalism]
- liberalism/chauvinism tension: tighten the role and you exclude plausible minds; loosen it and you ascribe minds too widely; the fix requires principled role constraints. [@levin2024functionalism]
- holism and fixation: functional roles are fixed by networks of roles; individuation risks circularity unless anchored by empirical psycho-functional theory. [@levin2024functionalism]
- narrow vs wide content: externalist arguments imply some mental contents depend on environment; purely internal role specs can’t capture wide content. [@levin2024functionalism]
- implementation sensitivity: if neuroscientific constraints (temporal codes, oscillatory binding) are partly constitutive, pure substrate-neutral roles are incomplete; add structural/dynamical invariants. [@levin2024functionalism]

## chinese room

- setup: a non-chinese speaker in a room follows a giant rulebook to map input symbols to output symbols so well that outside observers think they’re conversing in chinese. internally, it’s only syntax; no “understanding.” [@searle1980minds; @cole2023chineseroom] [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room)
- Searle’s claim is that syntax ==is not== semantics. Executing the right transition table is not sufficient for understanding; thus, bare computational/role equivalence underdetermines mentality. [@searle1980minds]
- pressure on functionalism: if a system perfectly instantiates the i/o role and internal transitions yet lacks understanding, role individuation looks incomplete.

functional replies:

- systems reply: the “person + book + room” composite realizes the understanding, not the person alone; you mislocate the subject. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room)
- robot reply: couple the controller to a body and sensorimotor loop; semantics is partially fixed by world-involving use (teleosemantic/enactive flavor). role must include embodied control. [@levin2024functionalism]
- brain-simulator reply: simulate the causal structure of a native speaker’s brain at sufficient granularity; if functional isomorphism holds, semantics rides along. [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room)
- internalization reply: memorize the whole book; now the person implements the system. many infer understanding emerges at scale; searle denies, but this exposes the intuition pump.

empirical/engineering handle:

- widen the role: test counterfactual generalization, transfer, grounded reference, and off-nominal control. if the system’s error dynamics and reference-resolving behavior match a speaker’s across interventions, treat the role as semantics-fixing.
- embed normative constraints: add objectives for truth-tracking, action-sensitivity, and learning under uncertainty (precision-weighted updates). if performance and adaptation match, the “syntax-only” critique weakens in practice. [@friston2017computationalnosology; @parr2018computationalneuropsychology]
- note: this operationalizes functionalism as rich, embodied, control-theoretic roles—close to psycho-functional and predictive variants above.
- note: this moves from "does it understand?" (philosophical) to "does it generalize, ground, and recover like a speaker?" (engineering). criteria replace essence. wittgenstein's "meaning is use" applied to AI.

## notes

- causal role constraints:
  - i/o profile: same upstream signals and downstream affordances for the task.
  - update rule: error-driven/predictive-coding style updates with comparable convergence and stability. [@parr2018computationalneuropsychology]
  - control loop: closed-loop behavior tracks setpoints with similar gains and phase margins; treat it as the same [[thoughts/state-space models|state-space]] controller.
  - self-maintenance: preserve the boundary conditions that keep the system viable (markov-blanket style separation). [@friston2017computationalnosology]
  - uncertainty handling: similar precision-weighting/attention to error. [@friston2017computationalnosology]

- implementation degrees of freedom:
  - substrate: wetware vs code vs silicon, fine. [@levin2024functionalism]
  - encoding: spikes/population codes vs dense vectors; as long as the role stays causally equivalent.
  - scheduling: event-driven vs clocked; keep effective dynamics iso-functional.
  - memory management: paged vs contiguous KV cache; role preserved under different allocators.
  - compression: variable-rate KV eviction per attention head; functional profile determines what compresses safely (Ada-SnapKV, QGC).
  - batching: continuous vs static; output distribution invariant to scheduling policy.

- sanity checks:
  - intervention compatibility: ablate/lesion corresponding parts and see role-level behavior stay isomorphic (cf. [[thoughts/Mechanistic interpretability|mechanistic interpretability]]).
  - error dynamics: same sign/magnitude response to perturbations; similar time-to-recover and steady-state error.
  - controllability/observability: same reachable/identifiable task facets under the same probes.

- [[thoughts/LLMs]] [[thoughts/vllm|inference]] as functional role:
  - [[thoughts/Autoregressive models|autoregressive]] generation = predictive control (predict, update, iterate).
  - [[thoughts/Attention]] = precision-weighting (which context matters).
  - RLHF = error-driven role refinement (adjust based on feedback).
  - constraints: energy/latency differ from biology; grounding requires counterfactual tests; no autopoietic closure (no self-model, no viability maintenance).

> minds are control patterns, not materials. you can port them if error dynamics, update rules, and self-maintenance stay fixed. engineering thesis, not metaphysics. use when useful. [@levin2024functionalism; @friston2017computationalnosology]
