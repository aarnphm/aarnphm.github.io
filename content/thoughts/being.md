What is being as a part of [[thoughts/Epistemology|epistemology]]?

## why do we practice art?

Practice anything, no matter how well or how bad, we practice art as a act of becoming, for our soul to grow.

## Heidegger's Being and Time

_NOTE: Heidegger's writing are relatively technical, hence I found this [glossary](http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/b_resources/b_and_t_glossary.html) useful when reading BnT_

To answer "What is being?", Heidegger began to ask "_Whom_ is asking the question being?"

> In a sense, he emphasize that being cannot exists without the context of other being in the world

```quotes
Being that in its Being is concerned about its very Being.
```

There are similarities between Kierkegaard and Heidegger understanding of existence, but Heidegger integrates it into his ontological difference.

```quotes
In the Being (Sein, ontological) of this being (Seiendes, ontical) it is related to its Being (Sein, ontological).
```

This is what distinguishes Dasein from any other being (Seiendes) - it is fully related to its own Being(Sein) and therefore privileged for an analysis of Being(Sein).

### tenet

Two core characteristics of dasein:

1. Dasein exists: "The essence of Dasein lies in its existence" (p.42).

2. Dasein is mine: "the Being, whose analysis our task is, is always mine" (p.42).

### context

[[thoughts/Value|Values]] are just meaningless facts (hammer is for hammering).
It leaves out information defining the relation of hammers to nails and the rest of the environment (readiness-to-hand)
In a sense, it explains entanglement (the example of workman and hammering)
