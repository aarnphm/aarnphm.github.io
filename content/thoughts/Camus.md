Of the absurd [[thoughts/reason|reasoning]] and [[thoughts/Existentialism|existentialism]].

## The Myth of Sisyphus

### Absurd and suicide

Suicide is the solution for the absurd:

- People never died because of ontological arguments
- Suicide is often the result of people who didn't find worth in the living
  - Life is not worth living therefore I took the easy way out

as a paradox:
- Suicide is the justification of meaning of life <- the most important question for philosophers
- From [[thoughts/Philosophy and Nietzsche|Nietzchean]] prose, those who say "no" acts as if they said "yes": Schopenhauer

Fantasise the act of eluding:

> Hope of another life one must "deserve" or trickery those who lives not for life itself but for some great idea that will transcend it, refine it, give it meaning, and betray it.

Logic is easy, but it is impossible to be logical to bitter end. It is considered truth if one decided to die at the hand of self, but does that mean life itself just have no meaning?

> **Absurd reasoning** is based on whether there are [[thoughts/logic|logic]] to reasons for men who died by their "own hands consequently follow to its conclusion of their emotional inclination"

The absurd come from the abject at birth, similar to end pages of the books starts from the beginning. To understand absurd is to understand the art of living, the world of intelligence.

Seemingly the questions of the absurd stems from question "Why". The wearing of a normal life, inaugurates the impulse of consciousness.

Heidegger: "mere anxiety [is] a source of everything."
