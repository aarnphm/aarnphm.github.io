Love is not a feeling that happens to you. It's a discipline, a practice, a continuous choice to attend to someone despite no guarantees. You choose to stay in the hermeneutic circle, to keep interpreting generously, to refuse instrumental understanding. [@kierkegaard1847worksoflove; @fromm1956art; @hooks2000love]

> [!summary] tl;dr
>
> love = choice + attention + practice. not conditioned response, not feeling, not possession. you decide to make someone central, to give them your interpretive attention, to stay with difficulty. ethics of care: particularity over universality, relational self, context-sensitive responsiveness. criteria: how they talk about them, what they notice, whether they stay when it's hard. resists compression—you can't love someone you've reduced to a function.

## not a feeling

If love were a feeling, it would be subject to extinction. Withdraw reinforcement, love disappears. Add punishment, love turns to avoidance. This is [[thoughts/Behavirourism|behaviorism's]] prediction: love is just positive reinforcement schedule.

Empirical failure: abusive relationships don't end quickly (high punishment). Secure relationships aren't just well-tuned reinforcement. People stay through illness, depression, long separation—all conditions that break behavioral contingencies.

Existentialist alternative: love is choice, not response. [@kierkegaard1847worksoflove; @fromm1956art; @hooks2000love] You commit not because they reinforce you but because you _decide_ to make them central. This decision persists despite absence of guarantees, despite changes, failures, disappointments.

Kierkegaard: love is duty you give yourself. "You shall love" makes love free—it's independent of the object's behavior. [@kierkegaard1847worksoflove] Not duty imposed from outside (that would be behaviorism: external reinforcement), but duty you choose. They can change; you chose this, you remain.

Fromm: love is art requiring discipline and practice. [@fromm1956art] Not stimulus triggering affective response, but activity you perform. The activity is voluntary: you choose to attend, to understand, to care—regardless of immediate reinforcement.

bell hooks: love is action. [@hooks2000love] When you understand love as action, you assume accountability. You can't say "I couldn't help it" (behaviorist excuse: environment controlled me). You chose. You're responsible.

[[thoughts/Camus]]: The misery and greatness of this world: it offers no truths, but only objects for love. Absurdity is king, but love saves us from it.

## what it requires

### attention

Simone Weil: "[[thoughts/Attention]] is the rarest and purest form of generosity." [@weil1952gravity] Not attention _to_ something you already understand, but attention that _constitutes_ understanding. You empty yourself, bracket instrumental concerns, become available to what they present.

Attention is not [[thoughts/Will|will]]. Will tries to force understanding; attention waits. Will imposes your framework; attention lets the framework shift. They might reorganize your whole way of seeing—if you let them.

Iris Murdoch: moral life happens mostly in ongoing attention, not discrete choices. [@murdoch1970sovereignty] How you _think_ about someone, how you imagine them, what you notice and ignore—this is where love operates. Seeing someone clearly requires discipline, spiritual exercise. You practice interpreting charitably, checking projections, staying open to revision.

You can behaviorally comply (eye contact, nod, repeat back) while completely absent. Attention resists third-person measurement. The gap between behavioral proxy and actual attention is everything.

### choice

Sartre: you're "condemned to be free"—even when you claim "I had no choice," you chose to see it that way. [@sartre1943being] This isn't libertarian free will (uncaused choice from nowhere). It's _situated_ freedom: you're shaped by history, but you still decide how to respond.

Choosing to love is choosing _despite_ absence of guarantees. No reinforcement schedule can make you do that. You do it because you decided it matters.

The same reinforcement history produces different people because people aren't passive recipients—they interpret, resist, reframe. Love requires this active stance: you take responsibility for your interpretation, your commitment, your continued choice to stay.

### hermeneutic practice

When you love someone, you choose to interpret them. Not once—continuously. You commit to staying in the [[thoughts/hermeneutics|hermeneutic circle]] even when understanding breaks down, even when they become strange to you.

"Giving someone your full" = giving them your interpretive attention. You make their horizon matter. You let their way of making sense affect how you make sense. You stay with difficulty instead of retreating to easy categories.

Gadamer: understanding happens through _fusion of horizons_ (_Horizontverschmelzung_). [@gadamer1960truth] You bring your world, they bring theirs. Understanding emerges where they meet—not by one absorbing the other, but by creating shared space. This takes time. You can't speed-read a person.

This is not naive interpretation (assuming you already understand). It's not instrumental interpretation (extracting what you need). It's _generous_ interpretation: giving benefit of doubt, seeking their internal logic, refusing to reduce them to a type.

The activity is interpretive: learning to see as they see, to care about what they care about, to inhabit their concerns without losing your own. [@fromm1956art]

When someone says "you don't understand me," they're right—understanding must be achieved, maintained, renewed. It's never automatic. [@hooks2000love]

### [[thoughts/Epistemology|epistemic]] humility

Hermeneutic humility: you might be wrong about them. Your current interpretation is provisional. Stay in the circle.

This connects to self-knowledge: you need to know your own framework, your projections, your instrumental concerns—so you can bracket them. Authenticity requires recognizing when you're in bad faith, when you're using them instead of understanding them.

Not claiming privileged access ("I know you better than you know yourself"). Not projecting your needs and calling it understanding. Not understanding _about_ them (facts, categories) instead of understanding _them_ (their horizon).

> People change. Your fusion of horizons must be redone, continuously. This is why love is practice, not possession.

## what it's not

Not: conditioned response to positive reinforcement. (If it were, extinction would end it.)

Not: stable state you achieve once. (Understanding requires continuous renewal.)

Not: projection of your needs. (That's using them, not loving them.)

Not: reduction to model or function. (Compression discards what makes them a person.)

Not: unconditional acceptance without judgment. (Love requires seeing clearly, which means seeing limitations, failures, contradictions—and choosing to stay anyway.)

Not: assuming you understand automatically. (Understanding is work, achievement, discipline.)

## ethics of love

### care ethics

Carol Gilligan, Nel Noddings: ethics of care emphasizes particularity over universality, relational self over autonomous individual, context-sensitive responsiveness over abstract principles. [@gilligan1982different; @noddings1984caring]

You don't love "humanity" or "the good"; you love _this_ person. Their particularity matters. Their context, their history, their specific way of making sense—not interchangeable with anyone else.

Relational self: you're not autonomous atom making rational choices in isolation. You're always already in relation. Love doesn't happen _to_ a self; it partly _constitutes_ the self. You become who you are through relationships, through being attended to and attending to others.

Care as work: emotional labor, interpretive labor, maintenance labor. Not automatic, not effortless. Requires attention, practice, renewal. Feminist ethics recognizes this labor (often invisible, often gendered) as essential to human flourishing. [@ruddick1989maternal; @kittay1999love]

Context-sensitive: you respond to their needs as _they_ articulate them, not as abstract principle dictates. Phronesis (practical wisdom): knowing what matters here, now, to this person. [@gadamer1960truth]

### virtue ethics

Aristotle: _philia_ (friendship/love) is central to good life. [@aristotle_nicomachean_ethics] Not instrumental (using friends for benefit) but intrinsic (friends are good in themselves). Reciprocal development: you flourish together.

Love as practice developing character. Patience, generosity, attention—these aren't pre-existing traits you apply to relationships. You _learn_ them through loving, through failing, through staying when it's hard. Virtue is acquired through practice.

Gadamer: understanding is form of phronesis—practical wisdom about what matters, how to proceed, what the situation calls for. [@gadamer1960truth] Not applying universal rule, but interpreting particular context. Love requires this: knowing when to push, when to wait, when to speak, when to listen.

Eudaimonia (flourishing): not individual achievement but shared life. You flourish _with_ them, not despite them or independent of them.

### existentialist ethics

Martin Buber: I-Thou vs I-It. [@buber1923i] When you treat someone as I-It, they're object of experience, means to your ends, functional role in your life. When you treat them as I-Thou, they're subject, irreducible presence, end in themselves.

Love requires I-Thou stance. You can't love someone you've made into I-It (instrument, function, type). The shift is not cognitive—it's existential. You choose to relate as subject-to-subject, not subject-to-object.

Emmanuel Levinas: face of the Other makes infinite demand. [@levinas1961totality] You're responsible for them not because you chose it (that would be contractual), but because their vulnerability, their alterity, their face confronts you. Ethics precedes ontology: responsibility comes before being.

Love intensifies this: you're accountable not just to abstract Other but to _this_ Other, whose particularity matters, whose horizon you've chosen to care about.

Sartre, de Beauvoir: authenticity vs bad faith. [@sartre1943being] Bad faith in love: pretending you had no choice, hiding behind roles ("I'm just like this"), refusing responsibility for your interpretation. Authenticity: owning your choices, recognizing your freedom, taking responsibility for how you see them.

### recognition

Paul Ricoeur: narrative identity. [@ricoeur1992oneself] You understand someone by understanding their story—not just facts, but _how_ they make sense of facts, what trajectory they see, what possibilities matter. Recognition is acknowledging their narrative authority: they get to tell their story.

Charles Taylor: frameworks of meaning. [@taylor1989sources] What someone cares about, what distinctions they draw, what they find significant—this is their framework. To love them is to take their framework seriously, to let it matter to you, even when it differs from yours.

Axel Honneth: recognition as constitutive of self-realization. [@honneth1995struggle] You need to be recognized—attended to, interpreted charitably, taken seriously—to flourish. Love provides this: sustained recognition that allows them to develop, to become, to change.

But recognition requires interpretive work. You can fail: misrecognize, impose your framework, refuse to see them as they are. Hermeneutic injustice: when your interpretive resources can't grasp their experience, or when you refuse to update your interpretation despite evidence.

Love fights this: you commit to recognizing them accurately, to expanding your framework when it fails, to staying in the hermeneutic circle until understanding emerges.

## criteria

Don't ask "what is love?" Ask: what does loving someone look like in practice?

Criteria are behavioral—but not reducible to reflex. You can tell someone loves another by:

- How they talk about them: what they notice, what they remember, what they find significant
- What they attend to: do they track the other's concerns? notice changes? stay curious?
- How they respond under stress: do they retreat to easy categories or stay with difficulty?
- Whether they stay when it's hard: through illness, conflict, uncertainty, change
- Whether their interpretation stays generous: benefit of doubt, seeking internal logic, checking projections
- How they handle being wrong: do they update? acknowledge? stay open?
- Whether they treat them as means or ends: instrumental (I-It) or relational (I-Thou)?

These are observable. But they're not stimulus-response. They're patterns of engagement that make sense only within a practice, a form of life. Love is language-game. You learn it by participating, not by collecting behavioral data.

[[thoughts/Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] lesson: criteria show what's going on without _being_ what's going on. You use behavior to recognize love, but love isn't identical to behavior.

## connection to [[thoughts/functionalism|functionalism]]

Can functional role capture love? Maybe: love is ability to predict, to intervene appropriately, to maintain relationship under perturbations. Engineering criteria, not essence.

But love resists reduction. If you treat someone as functional system to model, you've already stopped loving them. You've made them instrument of your prediction. The hermeneutic circle breaks.

[[thoughts/functionalism|Functionalism]] works for [[thoughts/LLMs]], control systems, role-playing. It might work for surface-level social navigation. But loving someone? You need first-person engagement, not third-person modeling. You need to care about their horizon because it's _theirs_, not because it serves your goals.

This is limit of [[thoughts/Compression|compression]]: you can't compress person to model without losing what makes them person. Love requires attending to what resists compression—their irreducibility, their first-person givenness, their capacity to surprise you.

[[thoughts/Behavirourism]] tries to compress persons to stimulus-response mappings. Lossy compression discards: first-person experience, attention, intention, the _reasons_ they act. You model the function (input → output) but miss the process (how they make sense, what it means to them, what they're trying to do).

This works when you don't care about person—only their behavior. Advertising, management, modification. It breaks when you need to understand them. Understanding requires entering their horizon (see [[thoughts/hermeneutics]]), not compressing them to model.

## thingspace

https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBw8dDkAWohFjWQSk/the-cluster-structure-of-thingspace

> This is the benefit of viewing robins as points in space: You couldn't see the linear lineup as easily if you were just imagining the robins[^robin] as cute little wing-flapping creatures.

[^robin]: A robin's DNA is a highly multidimensional variable, but you can still think of it as part of a robin's location in thingspace—millions of quaternary coordinates, one coordinate for each DNA base—or maybe a more sophisticated view that . The shape of the robin, and its color (surface reflectance), you can likewise think of as part of the robin's position in thingspace, even though they aren't single dimensions.

> We can even imagine a configuration space with one or more dimensions for every distinct characteristic of an object, so that the position of an object's point in this space corresponds to all the information in the real object itself. Rather redundantly represented, too—dimensions would include the mass, the volume, and the density. [^radial]

[^radial]: "Radial categories" are how cognitive psychologists describe the non-Aristotelian boundaries of words. The central "mother" conceives her child, gives birth to it, and supports it. Is an egg donor who never sees her child a mother? She is the "genetic mother". What about a woman who is implanted with a foreign embryo and bears it to term? She is a "surrogate mother". And the woman who raises a child that isn't hers genetically? Why, she's an "adoptive mother".

> The Aristotelian syllogism would run, "Humans have ten fingers, Fred has nine fingers, therefore Fred is not a human" but the way we actually think is "Humans have ten fingers, Fred is a human, therefore Fred is a 'nine-fingered human'."

We can think about the radial-ness of categories [^categories] in intensional terms, as described above—properties that are usually present, but optionally absent. If we thought about the intension of the word "mother", it might be like a distributed glow in thingspace, a glow whose intensity matches the degree to which that volume of thingspace matches the category "mother". The glow is concentrated in the center of genetics and birth and child-raising; the volume of egg donors would also glow, but less brightly.

[^categories]: Or we can think about the radial-ness of categories extensionally. Suppose we mapped all the birds in the world into thingspace, using a distance metric that corresponds as well as possible to perceived similarity in humans: A robin is more similar to another robin, than either is similar to a pigeon, but robins and pigeons are all more similar to each other than either is to a penguin, etcetera.

> This gives us yet another view of why words are not Aristotelian classes: the empirical clustered structure of the real universe is not so crystalline.

A natural cluster, a group of things highly similar to each other, may have no set of necessary and sufficient properties—no set of characteristics that all group members have, and no non-members have.

> When you draw a boundary around a group of extensional points empirically clustered in thingspace, you may find at least one exception to every simple intensional rule you can invent.
