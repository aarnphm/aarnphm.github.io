---

decomposition of a Hermitian, positive-definite matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. (used for [[thoughts/Monte-Carlo#simulations|Monte-Carlo simulations]])

$$
A = LL^{*}
$$

where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix with real and positive diagonal entries, and $L^{*}$ is the conjugate transpose of $L$.
