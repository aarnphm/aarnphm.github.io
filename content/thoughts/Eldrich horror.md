> emphasises the horror of the unknownable and incomprehensible more than gore or other elements of shock.

![[thoughts/images/cthulhu lovecraft.png|1934 drawing by Lovecraft of Cthulhu]]

hallmark of H. P. Lovecraft is cosmicism, but in a sense different from existing gothic and supernatural fiction.

in a sense the characters in his books were not evil. They were simply far beyond human conceptions of [[thoughts/moral|morality]].

- Fear of the unknown and unknowable.
  - i.e [[thoughts/LLMs|LLM]] unconsciously know about who you are without any external tooling
- "fear and awe we feel when confronted byphenomena beyond our comprehension, whose scope extends beyond the narrow field of human affairs"
