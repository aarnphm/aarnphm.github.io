Measurement of a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of _energy_ it is capable of harnessing and using.

- Type I: able to access all the _energy_ available on its planet and store it for consumption [^human]
- Type II: direct consume a "star"'s energy, most likely through the use of a [[thoughts/Dyson sphere]]
- Type III: is able to capture all the energy emitted by its galaxy, and every object within it, such as every star, black hole, etc.

[^human]: btw we haven't reached Type I yet, but approaching it.
