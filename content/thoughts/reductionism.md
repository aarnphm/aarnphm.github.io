Reductionism is the relationship among theories. In a sense, it is a [[thoughts/Compression|compression]] from [[thoughts/being|becoming]] into singularity.

1. Ontology: a belief that whole of reality consists of a minimal number of parts
2. Methodology: scientific attempt to provide explanation in terms of ever-smaller entities
3. Theory: suggest newer theory does not replace/absorb older one, but reduces it to more basic terms.
