## for the age of [[thoughts/LLMs|LLMs]]

_excerpt from [Geoffrey Lit's essay](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2023/03/25/llm-end-user-programming.html)_

## tool for thought

[Maggie's essay](https://maggieappleton.com/tools-for-thought), [Andy Matuschak's essay](https://numinous.productions/ttft/)

think of PKM, HCI, CSCW, knowledge graph

Bottom-up thinking from [[thoughts/Hypertext|hypertext]], or

a plethora of new _series of applications for application for tool for thoughts_

> became an _idea machine_ [^machine]

[^machine]: backed by people, companies, from Nadia Asparouhova's [Idea Machines](https://nadia.xyz/idea-machines) (2022)

We think of these as medium as programmers:

- medium is an expression
- Tool enable workflows

> Most of what we have think in history are usually Computational Medium of thoughts

## What should we do?

1. We need more grounding in cognitive science: embodied cognition, mind theory, ethnographic research.

Thinkers:

- Andy Clark (Natural born cyborgs):
  - hypermind hypothesis: in relationship between our brains and surrounding
- Gorge Lakoff and Mark Johnson (Metaphors We Live By)
- Barbara Tversky (Mind in Motion)
- Tim Ingold
- Bruno Latour
- Maurice Merleau-Ponty
- Marshall McLuhan
- Don Norman

> [!question]
>
> How do we represent spatial and aural tools for thoughts?

2. Complementary not competitive artifacts

Competitive: makes you reliant on the tool (google maps)

Complementary: teach you intuition (compass)

3. Focus on studying existing cultural practices, not computational objects

- Spatial memory (building memory palace)
- Classical rhetoric
- logical fallacies, uncover biases, question assumptions
- statistics and its lies
- Information literacy

Daniel Dennett's "Intuition pumps to check your reasoning"

- Rappoprt's rules
- Joosting
- Rathering

Text are efficient for embedding format, and become a limitations of spaces and memory.
