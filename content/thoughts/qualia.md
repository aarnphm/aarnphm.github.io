when i think about qualia, i’m usually not trying to define them cleanly; i’m noticing the stubborn feeling that my experiences have a "what-it’s-like" character that my functional stories don’t touch.

the hard part (for me) isn’t explaining what i _do_ when i see red. it’s explaining what red is _like_. the phenomenal character, the first-person givenness, the "what it's like" to have the experience—this is what keeps slipping out of my functionalist nets.

thomas nagel’s "what is it like to be a bat?" [@nagel1974bat] still shapes how i approach this. the question isn't about bat behavior, bat neurology, bat information processing. it's about bat _experience_. if i can't access the first-person perspective, i haven’t captured consciousness. and functional descriptions—input/output mappings, causal roles, computational states—feel like they never quite give me that perspective; they give me third-person structure.

## how the gap shows up in my thinking

chalmers’ easy/hard split is the cleanest version i know. [@chalmers1996consciousmind]

- easy problems: discrimination, integration, reportability, attention, wakefulness. these feel amenable to functional explanation; i can imagine specifying roles, implementing them, testing them.
- hard problem: why any of this feels like anything at all. why there's subjective experience accompanying the information processing.

when i try to map my intuitions, the gap doesn't feel like "unknown details" waiting to be filled; it feels structural. functional explanations tell me what systems _do_. phenomenal properties are about what systems _feel_. my brain treats those as different kinds of fact.

> [!example] how mary’s room hits me
> mary knows every physical and functional fact about color vision while living in a black-and-white room. when she leaves and sees red for the first time, i can’t shake the sense that she learns something new: what red is _like_. if that’s right, then functional/physical knowledge wasn’t complete. [@jackson1982epiphenomenalqualia; @jackson1986whatmary]

> the [[thoughts/knowledge argument]] is my way to keep this intuition organized: no amount of third-person functional description seems to capture first-person phenomenal character. the quale of red feels additional to the functional role of red-processing.

## access vs phenomenal consciousness (and why i care)

block’s access vs phenomenal distinction helps me keep my confusions sorted. [@block1995confusion]

- **access consciousness**: information poised for use in reasoning, report, action control. functional through and through—defined by availability, integration, control.
- **phenomenal consciousness**: what it's like, subjective character, qualia. not obviously functional.

these can come apart in ways that feel psychologically real to me:

- blindsight: visual information without visual experience.
- tip-of-the-tongue: a distinctive feel without full access to content.

for [[thoughts/functionalism]], this matters: if mental states are just functional roles, and phenomenal consciousness isn’t functional, then either phenomenal consciousness isn’t really mental (which i don’t buy) or my functionalism is missing something important.

## how functionalists push back (as i understand them)

when i read functionalist responses, they mostly fall into three patterns in my head:

1. **deny the extra thing.** qualia don’t exist as separate properties. "what it's like" talk is confused. all consciousness is access consciousness; phenomenal talk just picks out functional properties we haven’t analyzed clearly yet. [@dennett1988quining]\n - this still feels like a topic shift to me. when i ask about subjective experience and get told it's really just functional access, i notice a sense of loss—like the thing i was pointing at has been renamed away.\n\n2. **stuff qualia into the role.** expand the functional role: pain isn't just "state caused by damage that causes avoidance"; it's "state with phenomenal character q that's caused by damage and causes avoidance." [@levin2024functionalism]\n - this reads to me as labeling rather than explaining. the phenomenal character is now in the spec, but i don't see why _that_ character shows up, or how multiple realization is supposed to work if different phenomenal characters all satisfy the same role.\n\n3. **reduce experience to representation.** representationalism says phenomenal properties _are_ representational properties: what it's like to see red = representing red in the right way. representation is functional (information, tracking, control), so phenomenal properties reduce to functional properties after all. [@tye1995ten; @dretske1995naturalizing]\n - here i get stuck on underdetermination: same representational content, different phenomenal character (the [[thoughts/inverted spectrum]] stories). and some experiences—pains, moods, background bodily feelings—don’t obviously represent anything external.\n\nnone of these fully defuse my sense of an explanatory gap, but they do change how i think about what the gap might be _about_ (concepts? cognitive architecture? something metaphysical?).

## modal pressure i still feel

conceivability arguments keep this whole topic live for me:

- [[thoughts/philosophical zombies]]: functional duplicates without consciousness. if i can coherently imagine them, that tempts me to treat phenomenal properties as additional to functional properties.\n- [[thoughts/inverted spectrum]]: same functional role, different phenomenal character (your red = my green). if that really holds together, function doesn’t fix phenomenology.\n- [[thoughts/knowledge argument]]: knowing all functional facts still seems compatible (from the armchair) with not knowing what red looks like.

all three use the same pattern: show that phenomenal properties can vary independently of functional properties. if they can vary independently even in imagination, my brain wants to treat them as different kinds of thing—even if i’m not sure that’s good metaphysics.

## contemporary handles

**mechanistic interpretability and qualia.** When we decompose [[thoughts/LLMs]] into functional features via sparse autoencoders, we find causally individuated representations: direction X means "in French," direction Y means "talking about code." [@geiger2025causalabstraction] These are access properties—information available for downstream use. No pressure toward phenomenal properties.

Does the model have _what-it's-like_ to process French? Nothing in the functional decomposition tells you. The mechanistic story is complete without it. This is either evidence that qualia don't exist (functionalist conclusion) or evidence that functional analysis misses something (anti-functionalist conclusion).

The interpretability work doesn't settle the metaphysics. It just makes the question sharper: if we have complete functional understanding, complete causal decomposition, complete ability to predict and intervene—and still no phenomenal story—what are we missing? Or are we missing anything?

**embodied and enactive approaches.** Maybe the problem is treating qualia as intrinsic properties of brain states. Phenomenal character might be relational: how body-in-environment makes sense of perturbations, how organism maintains viability, how sensorimotor loops couple perception and action. [@thompson2007mind]

Redness isn't property of neurons or even neural-functional states. It's how visual system differentiates certain wavelengths for action-relevant purposes in ecological context. "What it's like" is _how it enables you to cope_. Functional role plus embodied context plus developmental history. Richer functional story, not escape from functionalism.

But does this capture first-person givenness? Or does it just add more third-person structure (embodiment, action, context) to the functional story? The enactivist says these aren't third-person when you're _living_ them—they're your engaged perspective. The critic says this still doesn't explain why engagement feels like anything.

## why it matters

The qualia problem isn't armchair speculation. It's live question for:

- **AI consciousness:** If we build systems that pass every functional test (report their states, behave appropriately, show attention dynamics), do they have phenomenal experience? Functional equivalence doesn't tell you. You need additional criteria—but what criteria, and why? [@chalmers1996consciousmind]

- **Clinical states:** Anesthesia, vegetative states, locked-in syndrome. What distinguishes unconscious functional processing from conscious functional processing? Access and report can fail while phenomenal experience continues (locked-in). They can be present while phenomenal experience is absent (general anesthesia, maybe). Clinical decisions require distinguishing these, but functional tests conflate them. [@block1995confusion]

- **Animal consciousness:** Which animals have phenomenal experience? Functional complexity (neural processing, behavioral flexibility) is measurable. Phenomenal consciousness isn't—unless you think it reduces to functional properties. The ethical stakes are high: suffering requires phenomenal consciousness, not just functional responses to damage.

- **Self-knowledge:** You have direct access to your phenomenal states but only indirect access to your functional states. You know what red looks like; you don't know how your visual system processes wavelengths. If mental states are functional roles, you don't know your own mind directly. Counterintuitive. Maybe self-knowledge is phenomenal knowledge, not functional knowledge.

The functionalist wants to explain mind in terms of causal structure—what things do, how they relate, what role they play. Qualia seem to be leftovers: properties that don't reduce to structure. Either they're illusions (eliminativism), or they're additional to functional story (dualism), or they're functional properties we haven't analyzed right yet (functionalism, optimistic). No consensus.

Wittgenstein's line: "The aspects of things that are most important for us are hidden because of their simplicity and familiarity." [@wittgenstein1953pi] Maybe qualia are too close, too immediate, too familiar to capture in functional terms. Or maybe the appearance of irreducibility is confusion—mistaking familiarity for metaphysical depth.

The debate continues. Which means the functionalist story about mind remains incomplete—or complete and missing nothing, depending who you ask.
