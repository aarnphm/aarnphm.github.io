"[[thoughts/papers/turing1950.pdf|Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]" introduces the idea of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to/or indistinguishable from that of a human.

This is also known for his Turing Test, which suggests that if a machine can converse with a human without the human realising they are interacting with a machine, then it could be considered [[thoughts/intelligence|intelligence]]. For LLMs:
