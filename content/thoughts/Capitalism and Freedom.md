1. registration
2. certification
3. licensing proper
   - against fraudulent claims:
     > It goes still farther in the direction of trenching upon the rights of individuals to enter into voluntary contracts.

> The most obvious social cost is that anyone of
> these measures, whether it be registration, certification, or licensure,
> almost ==inevitably becomes a tool== in the hands of [_a special producer group_]
> to obtain a **monopoly** position at the expense of the rest of the public.
