> When a complex entity exhibits properties, or behaviours that its parts do not have on their own.

Or how can complex properties emerge from simple rules.

We observe this from:

- [[thoughts/LLMs]], speculations at most [@wei2022emergentabilitieslargelanguage]
- Ants colonies
- mold simulations

In context of single agent within multi-agent systems, is it due to the rules itself ([[thoughts/reductionism|reductionist]]) or additional factors are involved here?
