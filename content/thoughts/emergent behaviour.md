> When a complex entity exhibits properties, or behaviours that its parts do not have on their own.

We observe this from:

- [[thoughts/LLMs]], speculations at most [@wei2022emergentabilitieslargelanguage]
- Ants colonies
- mold simulations

In context of single agent within multi-agent systems, is it due to the rules itself ([[thoughts/reductionism|reductionist]]) or additional factors are involved here?

## emergentism

> Once a certain level of complexity is reached, there is a kind of qualitative leap where completely new sorts of physical laws can "emerge"—ones that are premised on, but cannot be reduced to, what came before

- In this way, the laws of chemistry can be said to be emergent from physics: the laws of chemistry presuppose the laws of physics, but can’t simply be reduced to them.
- In the same way, the laws of biology emerge from chemistry: one obviously needs to understand the chemical components of a fish to understand how it swims, but chemical components will never provide a full explanation.
- In the same way, the human mind can be said to be emergent from the cells that make it up.
