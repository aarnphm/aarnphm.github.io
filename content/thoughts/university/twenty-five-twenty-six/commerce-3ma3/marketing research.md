Note on having the ==right== {{sidenotes[principles]: right goods/services to the right people at the right place at the right time at the right price, using the right promotion techniques}}

There are three axis:

- Consumer
- Systems
- Goal

There are a few axes for the nature for applied marketing research:

- {{sidenotes[programmatic]: generative, exploratory, "what could we do?" research. identifies opportunities and develops strategic options}}
- {{sidenotes[selective]: comparative, decisional, "which option?" research. tests between alternatives when choices are on the table}}
- {{sidenotes[evaluative]: measurement, post-hoc, "did it work?" research. assesses outcomes after implementation}}

## process

- identification of the problem and statement, and objectives
- creation of the _research design_
- choice of research method
- selection of the sampling procedure
- collections of data
- analysis of data
- writing and presentation of the report
- follow-up

> [!question]
> How do we define the problem?

problem definition separates the management decision (what action to take) from the research problem (what information is missing).

Q: How do we understand the decision-making environment?

> [!question]-
>
> Assume our business is a local fast-food restaurant, and our products are mainly hamburgers, fried chicken, fries, and soft drinks
>
> What specific information does the manager needs to know in order to decide whether to change the product strategy?
>
> for the product strategy decision, manager needs:
>
> - performance baselines:
>   - sales velocity by product (units/day, revenue contribution, margin per unit)
>   - customer traffic patterns (daypart analysis, weekday vs weekend)
>   - complaint/return rates by product
>   - inventory waste rates
> - customer intelligence:
>   - purchase bundles (what items sell together)
>   - repeat frequency by customer segment
>   - satisfaction scores by product
>   - consideration set (are we losing to mcdonald's or to chipotle?)
>   - demographic/psychographic profile of current customers vs target customers
> - market context:
>   - competitive menu positioning (are we cheaper? healthier? faster?)
>   - local market trends (delivery growth rate, health-conscious shifts, dietary restrictions prevalence)
>   - price elasticity by product category
> - operational constraints:
>   - kitchen capacity and equipment limitations
>   - supplier switching costs
>   - staff training requirements for new products
> - strategic alternatives:
>   - test results from any pilot menu items
>   - cost structure of potential new products vs current ones
>   - cannibalization risk (will new chicken sandwich eat burger sales?)
