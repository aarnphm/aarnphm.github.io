    "Statically typed programming languages, by their very definition, create context dependencies: each variable can only be used in the scope of its declaration and according to its declared type. In principle, context-dependencies can be specified with attribute grammars. For efficiency, context dependencies are handled by a global _symbol table_, which is updated during parsing to maintain the context at the point of analysis. A symbol table has two main operations:\n",
    "- on the declaration of an identifier, it is stored together with its properties in the symbol table;\n",
    "- on each occurrence of an identifier, its properties are looked up in the symbol table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, the symbol table is a mapping (dictionary) from identifiers to their properties. As the order of declaration in the source is used for code generation, the declarations are kept as _list of entries_ instead. The scoping rules of programming languages allow declarations to be nested. Thus, there is one list of entries for each _level_, and the symbol table is a list of lists."

    "Older languages like C and Pascal don't define the size of numeric data types but rather allow the compiler to choose the most efficient one for the target processor. The original C report only requires that `size(char) = 1` based on the underlying ASCII character. As leaving the size of numeric data types open impacts the portability of programs, other languages are specific. For example, the [Java language reference](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se11/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.2.1) gives the possible ranges of values, which imply:\n",
