    "Compilers convert computer programs in \"high-level\" languages to executable code. These lecture notes introduce the concepts of compilation and illustrate those by a compiler for a small imperative programming language. However, this series of notebooks and the accompanying exercises are not just about writing compilers! \n",

    "- You will learn to use parsing, analysis, and generation techniques for compilation and other syntax-directed processing, e.g. for use with query languages, mark-up languages, and protocols.\n",
    "You will see other topics in computing connected, particularly computer architecture, programming languages, formal languages, and operating systems.\n",
    "- You will appreciate efficiency issues in programming languages by understanding the memory layout of data types (e.g. arrays, objects) and compilation of control structures (e.g. short circuit evaluation, recursion), which leads to a more resource-conscientious programming style.\n",
    "- You will understand why, historically, programming languages are defined in the ways they are and be better prepared for new languages.\n",
    "- You will learn how compilation techniques (e.g. byte code, just-in-time, garbage collection) affect the suitability of programming languages for specific applications.\n",
    "- You will learn about optimization techniques and the impact of processor architectures, which will help you use compilers more effectively.\n",
    "- You will be aware of compiler construction tools (e.g., scanner and parser generators) and can judge whether and when to use them.\n",

    "Some programming languages, notably C [(Kernighan and Ritchie 1974)](#KernighanRitchie74) and Pascal [(Jensen and Wirth 1974)](#JensenWirth74), were originally defined with _single pass compilation_ in mind, due to the restricted size of main memory at that time: a single pass compiler generates target code while the source file is read. To allow static type checking and code generation with mutally recursive procedures, these languages have _forward declarations_ (called _function prototypes_ in C):\n",
    "```Pascal\n",
    "procedure p(x: integer); forward; (* forward declaration of p, without body *)\n",

For modern compilers, main memory restrictions are not a concern: limits of human comprehension has kept the size of individual source files unchanged over decades, but hardware technology has provided compilers with an abundance of main memory."
