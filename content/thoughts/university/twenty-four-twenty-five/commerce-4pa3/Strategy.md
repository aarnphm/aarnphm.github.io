Core Argument:

- Competition goes beyond direct rivals - it includes 4 other forces that shape industry structure
- Understanding these forces reveals opportunities and threats

The 5 Forces:

1. Threat of New Entrants

- Controlled by entry barriers: economies of scale, brand identity, capital needs, access to distribution
- High barriers + strong retaliation = low threat

2. Supplier Power

- Strong when: concentrated, unique products, not dependent on industry
- Can squeeze profits by raising prices/reducing quality

3. Buyer Power

- Strong when: concentrated buyers, standard products, price sensitivity
- Can force down prices and demand better service

4. Substitute Products

- Set ceiling on prices
- Threaten profits by limiting potential returns
- Most dangerous when improving price-performance trade-off

5. Industry Rivalry

- Intense when: many competitors, slow growth, high fixed costs
- Takes form of price wars, advertising battles, product launches

Strategic Implications:

1. Position

- Find where forces are weakest
- Build defenses against competitive forces
- Example: Dr Pepper avoiding direct competition with Coke/Pepsi

2. Influence

- Take offensive moves to alter competitive forces
- Shape industry structure to your advantage

3. Exploit

- Spot and capitalize on industry changes before rivals
- Use changes in competitive forces to identify strategic opportunities
