### 1. Goals

- Measurable targets for success
- Two categories:

  - Soft goals: social/qualitative targets (employee satisfaction, community impact)
- Must have clear goal structure and priorities

### 2. Product/Service Market Focus

- Defines what products/services to offer
- Identifies target markets and segments
- Four strategic options:
  - Penetration (existing products/existing markets)
  - Product development (new products/existing markets)
  - Market development (existing products/new markets)
  - Diversification (new products/new markets)

### 3. Value Proposition
