## Session 1

### Summary

John Spitman talked about advanced wealth management strategies tailored for high-net-worth clients and business owners. Spitman emphasized integrating behavioral
finance principles into discretionary investment management to mitigate biases like overconfidence, loss aversion, and the endowment effect.
Key themes included tax-efficient wealth transfer (e.g., lifetime capital gains exemptions, corporately owned life insurance),
business succession planning (partnership agreements, mid-market M&A), and structured fee models tied to asset tiers.
He highlighted RBC’s solutions, such as the Compass Plan for insurance-as-asset strategies and Royal Trust’s solvency protection, while critiquing common behavioral
pitfalls like frequent trading and equating volatility with risk.

### Evaluation

Spitman’s presentation excelled in bridging theoretical behavioral finance concepts (e.g., Kahneman’s endowment effect) with actionable strategies,
such as probate-optimized will structures and tiered fee models. His critique of Merrill Lynch’s findings on gender-based investment behavior added depth. The focus on tax minimization and business continuity was pragmatic. However, the dense technical content—such as gross-up dividend taxation
mechanics—might overwhelm listeners. Spitman’s engaging delivery and use of case studies (e.g., mid-market M&A recurring revenue models) enhanced relatability,
though broader macroeconomic context, like RBC’s 2025 outlook on Canadian equity markets, could have fortified his arguments [@rbc2024global].

### Application

This presentation offers critical value for business owners and wealth managers seeking to align client behavior with long-term financial goals.
For instance, Spitman’s emphasis on structured partnerships and insurance-as-asset strategies can mitigate succession risks in family-owned enterprises.
Governments could adopt his probate efficiency frameworks to reduce legal bottlenecks in estate transfers. A complementary perspective is found in @rbc2024global,
which underscores Canada’s sluggish productivity growth and immigration-driven GDP challenges, reinforcing Spitman’s advocacy for diversified portfolios
and tax-aware investing.

## Session 2

### Summary

Chris Polson and Dr. Christine Sawchuk presented an overview of the CBV (Chartered Business Valuator) program.
The session highlighted the role of the CBV Institute in providing education and certification for business valuation professionals.
Polson discussed his experience at Goldman Sachs and the importance of the CBV designation, while Sawchuk introduced the CBV program, which includes core
and elective courses, and can be completed through asynchronous online learning and webinars.
The session also touched on the efforts to unify the CBV program with other institutes around the world.

### Evaluation

The presentation provided valuable insights into the CBV program and its relevance in the field of business valuation.
Chris Polson shared his personal experiences and emphasized the significance of the CBV designation. However, his delivery was somewhat
opinionated, particularly in his comparison of the engineering profession with business roles, which may have detracted from the overall message.
Additionally, Polson's advocacy for the CBV designation did not clearly differentiate it from other certifications like the CFA or CFP, which could have
left the audience questioning the unique benefits of pursuing a CBV. In contrast, Dr. Christine Sawchuk's introduction to the CBV program was kind
and approachable, making her portion of the presentation more engaging and informative.

### Application

The information presented in this session is particularly relevant for professionals considering a career in business valuation or those looking to enhance their credentials in this field.
The CBV designation can be a valuable asset for individuals working in dispute resolution, mergers and acquisitions, and financial analysis.
For businesses, having CBV-certified professionals can ensure accurate and reliable valuations, which are crucial for strategic decision-making and compliance.
According to the CBV Institute, the CBV designation is recognized globally and can open up opportunities for international collaboration and career advancement [@CBV2025].

## Session 3

### Summary

Th fireside chat touched a range of topics, from Alex's "full-circle" reflections on his past experience at McMaster World Congressto present days, to career advice, emphasizing the importance of curiosity and early, open-minded collaboration (as exemplified by leaders like Marylin Lynch).
The session covered the unique offerings of ScotiaMcLeod, including its open architecture approach, which allows for a diverse range of products beyond those offered by the bank.
The speakers emphasized the importance of a comprehensive wealth plan that addresses various facets of a client's life, including insurance, business planning, wealth transfer,
and tax exemptions. The discussion also touched on the evolving nature of wealth management, with a shift from product-based to solution-based approaches, and the potential impact of AI in the industry.

### Evaluation

The fireside chat format provided an engaging and informative platform for the speakers to share their experiences and insights.
Pogacean highlighted the importance of curiosity and asking questions, while Barone emphasized the value of being open-minded and collaborating with advisors early on.
White shared his enthusiasm for working with campus communities and Western graduates. The session effectively conveyed the complexity nature of wealth management,
from portfolio management to estate planning. However, the discussion could have benefited from more concrete examples or case studies to illustrate the practical
application of their advice.

### Application

The insights shared during this fireside chat are highly relevant for both current and aspiring wealth management professionals. The emphasis on a comprehensive and
client-centric approach to wealth management can be applied across various industries, including engineering, where understanding client needs and providing
tailored solutions are crucial. The recommendation of books such as "Atomic Habits" by James Clear and "The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel underscores
the importance of continuous learning and behavioral finance in professional development. A complementary perspective is found in @scotia2024, which forecasts 2025’s moderated GDP growth and
interest rate trajectories, aligning with the panel’s emphasis on dynamic, solution-oriented planning.
