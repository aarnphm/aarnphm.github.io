## 1. SQL

> [!question] Q1
>
> Find all passengers, between the ages of 20 and 30 (inclusive), who have a "Vegan" or "Vegetarian" dietary preference. Return their ID, name, and age.

```sql
SELECT
    p.personid AS id,
    p.name,
    p.age
FROM person p
JOIN passenger pass ON p.personid = pass.personid
WHERE
    p.age BETWEEN 20 AND 30
    AND pass.dietarypref IN ('Vegan', 'Vegetarian')
ORDER BY p.personid;
```

> [!question] Q2
>
> a. Find the number of airplanes that exist for each model. Return the model and the count for each model.
> b. Extend your query from (a) to find the number of airplanes in each model for any of the following airlines: ‘Air Canada’, ‘Etihad Airways’, or ‘United Airlines’. Return the name of the airline, the model, and the number of airplanes.

```sql

## 3. Indexes

The following includes two possible indexes:

### $\text{(FlightNo, DeptDate)}$ on `ScheduledFlight` table

- Attributes: (FlightNo, DeptDate) on `ScheduledFlight` table
- Properties: composite index on both attributes , clustered index respectively
- Benefits
  - Q3, Q4, Q7b given these queries heavily join with ScheduledFlight and filter on depature dates
  - composite nature supports queries that use both FlightNo and DepDate in joins (frequently due to the foreign key relationship with Ticket table)
  - Since these fields are part of the primary key of ScheduledFlight and are frequently used in joins with Ticket
  - help with range scan on DepDate

### $\text{(RouteID, AirlineAlias)}$ on `Use` table

- Attributes: (RouteID, AirlineAlias) on `Use` table
- Properties: composite index., unclustered index respectively
- Benefits:
  - Q5a, Q5b, Q7a and indirect Q4
  - given these rely on route-airline relationship
  - Q5a needs to count distinct airlines per route, so this index eliminate this scan
  - Q7a looks for ACA airline routes, so this will provide direct access
  - Being unclustered is appropriate as `Use` is frequently accessed for lookups but doesn't require physical ordering
