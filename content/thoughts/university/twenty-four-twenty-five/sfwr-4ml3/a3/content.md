| Differences        | multi-class linear SVM                                                                                                           | end-to-end multi-class SVM                                                                             |

| Architecture       | Through a single linear layers based on given input_size and `num_classes`                                                       | optimized over pairs of class scores with multi-vector encoding                                        |
| Parameter Learning | Uses [[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-4ml3/Stochastic gradient descent\|SGD]] with minibatches to optimize MML | Whereas we show a theoretical formulation of optimizing over multi-vector encoded space [^theoretical] |

[^multiloss]: [[thoughts/PyTorch#MultiMarginLoss|Loss]] is defined as: $\text{loss}(x,y) = \frac{\sum_{i} \max{0, \text{margin} - x[y] + x[i]}^p}{x.\text{size}(0)}$

[^theoretical]: Given input $(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_m, y_m)$

    parameters:

    - regularization parameter $\lambda > 0$
    - loss function $\delta: \mathcal{Y} \times \mathcal{Y} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{+}$
    - class sensitive feature mapping $\Psi: \mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^d$

    In this case, we solve for

    $$
    \min_{w \in \mathbb{R}^d} (\lambda \|w\|^2 + \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \max_{y^{'} \in \mathcal{Y}}(\delta (y^{'}, y_i) + \langle w, \Psi (x_i, y^{'}) - \Psi (x_i, y_i) \rangle))
    $$

The following includes graph for both accuracy and loss on train/test sets after 100 epochs

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-4ml3/a3/t1-partb.webp]]

Last epoch results for both train and test sets:

```prolog
-------------------------------------------------------------
Epoch 100 - Train loss: 0.016170, Train accuracy: 100.00%
         - Test loss: 0.165001, Test accuracy: 78.50%
-------------------------------------------------------------
```

We observe training accuracy continuing to improve, while test accuracy plateaus. Same observation can be made for in `Loss vs. Epochs` graph, where gap between training and test loss increases as epochs increase

_==While this shows evidence of overfitting, one can argue there are factors affecting model performance:==_

**Liminal training data**:

- we are currently only use 0.25% of MNIST dataset (which is around 150 samples) [^size]
- This makes it difficult for the model to learn generalizable patterns

[^size]: MNIST datasets are [60000](https://keras.io/api/datasets/mnist/) 28x28 grayscale images, therefore $0.25/100 * 60000 = 150$ samples being used

**Model limitation**:

- Linear SVM can only learn linear decision boundaries
- MNIST datasets requires non-linear decision boundaries to achieve high performance (we observe this through relatively quick plateau test accuracy after 78.5%)

Yes, but the result is highly sensitive based on given weight decay value.

1. with `weight_decay = 0.1` we observe the best performance, with training accuracy reaches to 99.33%, smaller gap between train and test loss. Smooth learning curves with stable conversion.
2. with `weight_decay = 1` we saw a decrease in training accuracy, larger gap between training and test loss, training become a bit unstable with fluctuation in accuracy, and regularisation is too strong, which affect learning
3. with `weight_decay = 10`, we saw it severely impairs model performance, given that it is too restrictive. Unstable training, high loss values, regularisation is too aggressive.

> Small dataset makes the model more sensitive to regularisation. Linearity makes it lax to require regularisation.

> Weight decay does help when properly tuned, and make learning a bit more stable.

## task 2: Logistic Regression for MNIST classification

> [!question] part a
>
> Use Cross Entropy Loss (rather than Hinge loss) to implement logistic regression

_context_:

- Hinge Loss: it penalized predictions that are not sufficiently confident. Only cares about correct classification with sufficient margin

- cross-entropy:

  For binary loss is defined:

  $$
  L(y, p(x)) = -(y * \log(p(x)) + (1-y) * \log (1-p(x)))
  $$

  For multi-class is defined:

  $$
  L(y, p(x)) = - \sum y_i * \log(p_i(x))
  $$

The following is the graph entails both accuracy and loss on train/test dataset:

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-4ml3/a3/t2-partb.webp]]

```text
-------------------------------------------------------------
Epoch 100 - Train loss: 2.3271, Train accuracy: 8.67%
          - Test loss: 2.3272, Test accuracy: 8.20%
-------------------------------------------------------------
```

No sign of overfitting, given training/test accuracy are very close together. Training loss and test loss curves are pretty close

The reason for poor performance are as follow:

- random chance baseline: for 10-class problem, random guessing would give ~10% accuracy, so it perform a bit worse.
- The model doesn't seem to learn at all. It perform significantly worse than SVM.
- Cross-entropy loss might need additional tuning.
- Non-linearity: Given that MNIST data contains non-linear features, it might be hard for LR to capture all information from training dataset.

> [!question] part c
>
> Does it work better, worse, or similar?

Significantly worse, due to the difference in loss function.

## task 3: non-linearity

> [!question] part a

> Add a hidden layer with 5000 neurons and a RELU layer for both logistic regression and SVM models in Task 1 and Task 2.

The following is the modified version of LinearSVM with hidden layers:

```python
class ModifiedModel(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):
    super().__init__()
    self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
    self.relu = nn.ReLU()
    self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)

  def forward(self, x):
    x = x.view(-1, input_size)
    x = self.fc1(x)
    x = self.relu(x)
    return self.fc2(x)
```

```

  def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):

    self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)

  def forward(self, x):
    x = x.view(-1, input_size)

    x = self.relu(x)
    return self.fc2(x)

> [!question] part b
>
> Compare the results with the linear model (without weight decay, to keep the comparison fair). Which approach works better? Why? Which appproach is more prone to overfitting? Explain your findings and justify it.

Linear model works better in this case, even thought it achieve lower loss, similar test accuracy. The added complexity of the hidden layer and [[thoughts/optimization#ReLU|ReLU]] activation didn't improve the model's performance given the dataset size (too small)

The problem set might be linearly separable enough such that the model simply learns to generalise overall behaviour of the whole dataset (also known as grokking [^grokking]).

[^grokking]: [[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability#grokking|grokking]] is a process where neural network learns a pattern in the data, and it "memorize" this pattern to generalize to all unseen dataset, in which improve generalisation performance from random chance to perfect generalisation! Though, this phenomena is often observed in larger networks beyond overfitting.

> Note that overfitting suggests that there weren't enough data in given training sets, given we observe similar test metrics for both `LinearSVM` and `ModifiedModel` (with ReLU and hidden layers)

So it is not necessary "which works better", rather it should be about limited training data rather than architectural options.

## task 4: data augmentation

> [!note]+ instruction
>
> In this task, we will explore the concept of data augmentation, which is a powerful technique used to enhance the diversity of our training dataset without collecting new data. By applying various transformations to the original training images, we can create modified versions of these images.
> We can then use these modified images to train our model with a "richer" set of examples. The use of data augmentation helps to improve the robustness and generalization of our models. Data augmentation is particularly beneficial in tasks like image classification, where we expect the model to be invariant to slight variations of images (e.g., rotation, cropping, blurring, etc.)
>
> For this task, you are given a code that uses Gaussian Blur augmentation, which applies a Gaussian filter to slightly blur the images. If you run the code, you will see that this type of augmentation actually makes the model less accurate (compared with Task 3, SVM test accuracy)
>
> For this task, you must explore other types of data augmentation and find one that improves the test accuracy by at least 1 percent compared with not using any augmentation (i.e., compared with Task 3, SVM test accuracy). Only change the augmentation approach, and keep the other parts of the code unchanged. Read the PyTorch documentation on different augmentation techniques [here](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html), and then try to identify a good augmentation method from them.
>
> Report the augmentation approach that you used, and explain why you think it helps. Also include train/test accuracy plots per epoch, and the train/test accuracy at the final epoch.

The following augmentation achieves higher test accuracy comparing to `ModifiedModel` without any transformation

```python
augmentation = transforms.Compose([
  # Small random rotation with higher probability of small angles
  transforms.RandomRotation(degrees=3, fill=0),  # Even more conservative rotation
  # Very subtle random perspective
  transforms.RandomPerspective(distortion_scale=0.15, p=0.3, fill=0),
  # Convert to tensor
  transforms.ToTensor(),
  # Normalize to improve training stability
  transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,)),  # MNIST mean and std
  # Extremely subtle random noise
  transforms.RandomAdjustSharpness(sharpness_factor=1.2, p=0.3)
])
```

### **Explanation**

`ToTensor` is self-explanatory. Additional augmentation playground can also be found in the [[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-4ml3/a3/svm.ipynb|jupyter notebook]]

#### `RandomRotation`

- we use $+-3$ degrees given that digits can appear at slightly different angles in said dataset
- small rotation preserves readability, while increase variety
- fill set to 0 to preserve black background

#### `RandomPerspective`

- add a small distortion scale to simulate viewing angle variations.
- help with robustness to viewpoint change

#### `Normalise`

- Add MNIST mean and std to normalise training
- make it more stable

#### `RandomAdjustSharpness`

- Simulate some random noise
- One can also use `RandomErasing`, but the essentially work the same

### results

The following is the final epoch result:

```text
-------------------------------------------------------------
Epoch 100 - Train loss: 0.015159, Train accuracy: 99.33%
         - Test loss: 0.183071, Test accuracy: 81.10%
