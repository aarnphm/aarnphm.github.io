## convolution

accept volume of size $W_1 \times H_1 \times D_1$ with four hyperparameters

- filters $K$
- spatial extent $F$
- stride $S$
- amount of zero padding $P$

1D convolution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y &= (x*w) \\
y(i) &= \sum_{t}x(t)w(i-t)
\end{aligned}
$$

2D convolution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y &= (x*w) \\
y(i,j) &= \sum_{t_1} \sum_{t_2} x(t_1, t_2) w(i-t_1,j-t_2)
\end{aligned}
$$

## max pooling

idea to reduce number of parameters

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-4ml3/max-pooling.webp]]

## batchnorm

$$
x^{j} = [x_1^j,\ldots,x_d^j]
$$

Batch $X = [(x^1)^T \ldots (x^b)^T]^T$
