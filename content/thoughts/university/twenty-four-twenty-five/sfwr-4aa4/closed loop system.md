For determine discrete systems and vice versa.

## $G(z)$ with a Zero-Order hold

$$
G(z) = (1-z^{-1}) Z[\frac{G_p(s)}{s}] = G^{*}(z) - z^{-1}G^{*}(z)
$$

example: Find $G(z)$ if $G_p(s) = \frac{s+2}{s+1}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
G^{*}(s) &= \frac{G_p(s)}{s} = \frac{2}{s} - \frac{1}{s+1} \\[8pt]
g^{*}(t) &= 2 - e^{-t} \quad (\text{inverse Laplace transform}) \\
g^{*}(kT) &= 2 - e^{-kT} \\
G^{*}(z) = \frac{2z}{z-1} - \frac{z}{z-e^{-T}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## block diagram reduction

a. $C(z) = G_1(z) G_2(z) E(z)$
b. $C(z) = Z[G_1(s) G_2(s)]E(z)$

> [!note]
>
> The product of $G_1(s)G_2(s)$ must be evaluated first

## model for Open-loop system

The output of open-loop system is

$$
C(z) = G(z)D(z)E(z)
$$

## closed loop sample data system

$$
\begin{aligned}
E(z) &= R(z) - Z[G(s)H(s)]E(z) \\[12pt]
&\because \frac{C(z)}{R(z)} = \frac{G(z)}{1+Z[G(s)H(s)]}
\end{aligned}
$$

### using digital sensing device

$$
C(z) = \frac{Z[G(s)R(s)]}{1+Z(G(s)H(s))}
$$

### using digital controller

$$
\frac{C(z)}{R(z)} = \frac{G_{1}(z)G_{1}(z)}{1+G_{1}(z)Z(G_{2}(s)H(s))}
$$

## time response

$$
T(z) = \frac{G(z)}{1+G(z)}
$$
