> People do not buy products, they buy solutions to their problems.

A good requirements is

- necessary
- verifiable
- attainable

Goals: desired results for target organisation

- obstacles: property to be overcome
  Behaviour:
- functional: outcome produced by _system_
- non-functional: property of how system achieves outcomes
  Constraints:
- imposed by environment

VARIED framework:

Vivid: actually meet the persona
Actionable: it should ==help the team== to build the product
Real: where user are, observe and interact
Identifiable: dog-food
Exact: Be specific
Detailed: Good personas are substantials

> [!tldr] Requirement Engineering
>
> is a **human activity** based on cognitive psychology, anthropology, sociology, and linguistics

## SSON (Single Statement of Need)

> clear, concise statement about ==system's overall goals== and ==how it will accomplish== those goals

- describe what **capability the system** being developed will provide

## goal.

> convey **intention/rationale/objective** of stakholders

- support _elicitation, analysis, and provide inputs for specification_

Actor: act within a system to achieve the goal
Agent: act on behalf of other actors
Role: an actor can play $0 \cdots n$ roles
Position: consistent roles that are cohesive

> [!note] Hard Goal
>
> Can **measure**, quantify and describe in their entirety

> [!note] Soft Goal
>
> We know we need but cannot describe fully

Resource: Can be used to achieve goals by an actor

Plans: how actor will execute actions

### resolving soft goals

1. Definitions: convert soft => hard

2. Contributions: create sub goals to solve soft goals as functions

3. Decomposition: decompose soft to multiple sub goals

## Risks.

flexible, adaptive, and changeable

> potential events can impact your project progress

Issues: known problems can be identified

Risk (what if) => issues (current)

who to contact

how to mitigate such risks

> calm, figure out root cause, and come up with solutions

### RACI matrix

Responsible
Accountable
Consulted
Informed

### fish-bone diagram

scope creep

risk register

risk assessment

### probability and impact matrix

inherent risk: measure of a risk, calculated by its probability and impact

time risks

budget risks

scope risks: not be able to deliver milestones

external risks:

Single point of failure: risk that has potential to cause a catastrophic failure.

dependency: relations between different tasks

### mitigation strategies

- avoid
- accept
- reduce and control (use decision tree)
- transfer

## Requirements of Oppression

socio-technical, DEI => social infrastructure that reflect, reinforce, and amplify the matrix of oppression

- Gender
- Ability
- Race

Bias in data

1. Center the margins, or increase more diversity
2. social conflict?
3. Human-centric

## [[thoughts/tacit knowledge]]

## modelling

> conceptual representation of something
