## question 1.

> [!question] a
>
> If $L_{1}$ is regular and $|L_{1}| = k$ and $L_{2}$ is non-regular, then $L_{1} \cap L_{2}$ is regular

$\boxed{\text{True}}$

$L_{1} \cap L_{2} = L_{3}$ implies $L_{3} \subseteq L_{1}$ (intersection)

Given that $|L_{1}| = k$, meaning there is a fixed number of string in $L_{1}$ ,therefore $L_{1}$ is finite. Given that all finite language are regular, $L_{1} \cap L_{2}$ will contain at-most $k$-string, making $L_{3}$ regular

> [!question] b
>
> If $L_{1}$ is regular and $L_{2}$ is non-regular, then $L_{1} \cup L_{2}$ is regular

$\boxed{\text{False}}$

If $L_{1} = \{ ab \}$ where it only accepts the string $ab$, and $L_{2} = \{ a^n b^n | n \geq 0 \}$, then $L_{1} \cup L_{2} = \{ a^n b^n | n \geq 0 \}$, which is non-regular

> [!question] c
>
> $\forall L_{1}$ such that $L_{1}$ is a non-regular language, $\exists L_{2}$ such that $L_{2}$ is regular and $L_{1} \subseteq L_{2}$

$\boxed{\text{True}}$

For all non-regular languages $L_{1}$, they can be seen as a subset of $\Sigma^{*}$. Given that $\Sigma^{*}$ is regular (a DFA with one accepting state), this means the aforementioned statement holds.

## question 5.

> [!question]
>
> Create a sound argument that the concatenation of two regular languages is also regular. Specifically, if $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are regular then $L_{1} L_{2}$ is also regular.
> This does not need to be a formal proof, but the argument should be very convincing.
>
> _Hint_: if $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are regular you can make "machines" for them; how would you make a "machine" for $L_{1} L_{2}$.

Given $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ are both regular languages, there exists and DFA $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ that recgonize $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ respectively

Let $M_{1} = (Q_{1}, \Sigma, \delta_1, q_{01}, F_{1})$ and $M_{2} = (Q_{2}, \Sigma, \delta_2, q_{02}, F_{2})$

We can try to construct a NFA $N$ to recognize $L_{1} L_{2}$, where we combine both states of $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ via product construction, then we add $\epsilon$-transition from every accepting state in $F_{1}$ to start state $q_{02}$ of $M_{2}$

Conceptually, for a string $w \in L_{1} L_{2}$, split $w = uv, u \in L_{1}, v \in L_{2}$

- If $N$ process $u$ in $M_{1}$, reach accept states $F_{1}$, then $\epsilon$ transition to $q_{02}$, then process $v$ in $M_{2}$, ending in $F_{2}$
- if no valid splits, then it rejects the string
- for empty string: if $\epsilon \in  L_{1}$ then it can transition to $M_{2}$, and vice versa.

Given that regular language are also closed under NFAs, if we can build a NFA which proves that $L_{1} L_{2}$ is regular

$\boxed{\text{q.e.d}}$
