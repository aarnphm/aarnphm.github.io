We stopped here, given that 7,8,9 doesn't contains any direct transition on a to any final states.

The final transition table are as follows:

We have the following states are equivalent:

The Pumping lemma also **holds** for finite regular language as well.

We need to show that if we assume $L$ is finite, then the pumping lemma is True.

Now, there exists a longest string in L called $m$, choose $k^{'} = |m|$

Consider the "forall" section $\forall x,y,z \mid xyz \in L \land |y| >k$ is _False_:

- For any string $xyz \in L$ we know that $|xyz| \le m$ (since m is the longest string in $L$)
- since $y$ is a substring of $xyz$, we must have $|y| \le |xyz| \le m = k$

Given that the antecedent ("if" part) of an implication is false, the entire implication is vacuous truth (when the set is empty)

Therefore, the entire condition is true via vacuous truth (it holds trivially, as there are no strings $xyz \in L \mid |y| > k$)

> [!question] Question 4
>
> Using the Pumping Lemma, prove the following languages are not regular.

> $L = \{ a^{nm} b^{m} a^{n} \mid n,m \ge 0 \}$

1. The demon first pick $k=n=m$
2. Choose $x=a^{k^{2}}, y=b^{k}, z=a^{k}$
3. pick $u=b^{j},v=b^{r},w=b^{l}$ such that $j+r+l=k, r>0$
4. pick $s^{'}  = xuv^{i}wz = a^{k^{2}}b^{j}(b^{r})^{i}b^{l}a^{k}$
   use $i=2$ we have
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   s^{'}&=a^{k^{2}}b^{j}b^{2r}b^{l}a^{k} \\
   &=a^{k^{2}}b^{r}b^{k}a^{k}
   \end{aligned}
   $$
5. That $s^{'} \notin L$, therefore $L$ is not regular

$\boxed{q.e.d}$

> $L = \{ww \mid w \in \Sigma^*\}$

1. The demon pick k
2. Choose $x=a^{k}b,y=a^{k},z=b$
3. pick $u=a^{j},v=a^{r},w=a^{l}$ such that $j+r+l=k, r>0$
4. pick $s^{'}  = xuv^{i}wz = a^{k}ba^{j}(a^{r})^{i}a^{l}b$
   use $i=2$ we have
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   s^{'}&=a^{k}ba^{j}a^{2r}a^{l}b \\
   &=a^{k}ba^{r}a^{k}b
   \end{aligned}
   $$
5. That $s^{'} \notin L$, therefore $L$ is not regular

$\boxed{q.e.d}$

> $L = \{a^{k^{3} }  \mid k \ge 0\}$

1. The demon pick k
2. Choose $x=z=\epsilon,y=a^{k^{3}}$
3. pick $u=a^{j},v=a^{r},w=a^{l}$ such that $j+r+l=k^{3}, r>0, j+r\le k$
4. pick $s^{'}  = xuv^{i}wz = a^{j}(a^{r})^{i}a^{l}$
   use $i=2$ we have
   $$
   \begin{aligned}
   s^{'}&=a^{j}(a^{r})^{2}a^{l} \\
   &=a^{k^{3}+r}
   \end{aligned}
   $$
   We can prove that $k^{3} < k^{3}+r <(k+1)^{3}$
   - Since $r>0$, we have $k^{3}<k^{3}+r$
   - Given $r\le k$ therefore $(k+1)^{3} = k^{3}+3k^{2}+3k+1 > k^{3} + k \ge k^{3}+r$
     Therefore, $k^{3}+r$ cannot be a perfect cube
5. That $s^{'} \notin L$, therefore $L$ is not regular
