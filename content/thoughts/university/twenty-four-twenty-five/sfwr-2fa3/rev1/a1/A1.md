## Q1.

For each statement below, state if it is true or false, and explain why. The explanation does not need to be a formal proof, but the argument should be sound.

> [!question] Statement a
> If $L_1$ is regular and $|L_1| = k$ and $L_2$ is non-regular, then $L_1 \cap L_2$ is regular.

This statement is **false**.

All finite languages are regular. $|L_1| = k$ implies that $L_1$ is finite, and therefore regular. The intersection of a regular language and a non-regular language is not guaranteed to be regular.

Note that all string under $L_1 \cap L_2$ must be a subset of $L_1$, and a subset of a finite language is finite, therefore regular.

For example, let $L_1$ be a regular language that contains a string $a^nb^n$ and $L_2 = \{a^nb^n\}$.

The intersection of $L_1 \cap L_2$ is non-regular.

> [!question] Statement b
> If $L_1$ and $L_2$ are non-regular, then $L_1 \cup L_2$ is regular.

This statement is **false**.

The union of a regular and a non-regular language is not guaranteed to be regular.

A language is regular if there is an finite automaton that accepts it.

Note that $L_1$ is a regular language, therefore finite, and $L_2$ is non-regular, therefore there does not exist a finite automaton that accepts it.

If $L_1 \cup L_2$ is regular, then there must exist a finite automaton that accepts it. However, such automaton would also accept $L_2$ since $L_2 \subseteq L_{1} \cup L_2$, therefore meet contradiction.

Which renders the statement **false**.

> [!question] Statement c
> $\forall L_1 \mid L_1 \text{ :non-regular, } \exists L_2 \mid L_2 \text{ :regular} \land L_{1} \subseteq L_{2}$

This statement is **true**.

Let $\Sigma$ be the alphabet of $L_1$., choose $L_2 = \Sigma^{*}$, which is regular.

Since $\Sigma^{*}$ is the set of all strings formed from $\Sigma$ plus empty string, it is guaranteed to contain $L_1$. Therefore $L_1 \subseteq \Sigma^{*}$. Therefore, $L_1 \subseteq L_2$

## Q2.

Create a DFA $M$ such that:

> [!question] Statement a
> M accepts all strings which begin with $b$ but do not contain the substring $bab$.

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-2fa3/rev1/a1/dfa_2a.svg]]

> [!question] Statement b
> $\mathcal{L}{(M)} = \lbrace a^ib^jc^k \mid i+j+k \text{ is a multiple of 3} \rbrace$, $\Sigma = \lbrace a,b,c \rbrace$

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-2fa3/rev1/a1/dfa_2b.svg]]

> [!question] Statement c
> $\mathcal{L}{(M)} = \lbrace x \mid \text{at least two a's in last three characters of x} \rbrace$

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-2fa3/rev1/a1/dfa_2c.svg]]

## Q3.

Via product construction, create a DFA $M$ such that

$$
\mathcal{L}(M) = \{ a^n b^m \mid n \lor m \text{ is a multiple of 3} \}
$$

First create two machine: one where $n$ is a multiple and one where $m$ is a multiple of 3. Then create the "union" machine:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L}(M_1) &= \lbrace a^nb^m \mid n \text{ is a multiple of 3} \\\
\mathcal{L}(M_2) &= \lbrace a^nb^m \mid m \text{ is a multiple of 3}
\end{align*}
$$

First, we will construct $M_1$:

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-2fa3/rev1/a1/dfa_3a.svg]]

Then, we will construct $M_2$:

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-2fa3/rev1/a1/dfa_3b.svg]]

From product construction, we will create $M$ based on $M_1$ and $M_2$:

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-2fa3/rev1/a1/dfa_23.svg]]

## Q4.

Create an NFA which accepts all string in which the third last character is an $a$. Then via subset construction, create an equivalent DFA. Show all your work

_Solution_

We define the following NFA $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$ with:

- $Q = \{q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4\}$
- $\Sigma = \{a, b\}$
- Start state $q_0$
- Accept state $q_{3}$
- Transition function $\delta$ as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\delta(q_0, a) &= \{q_0, q_1\} \\\
\delta(q_0, b) &= \{q_0\} \\\
\delta(q_1, a) &= \{q_2\} \\\
\delta(q_1, b) &= \{q_2\} \\\
\delta(q_2, a) &= \{q_3\} \\\
\delta(q_2, b) &= \{q_3\} \\\
\delta(q_3, a) &= \{q_4\} \\\
\delta(q_3, b) &= \{q_4\} \\\
\delta(q_4, a) &= \{q_4\} \\\
\delta(q_4, b) &= \{q_4\}
\end{align*}
$$

Via subset construction, we can create the following DFA:

Start state of DFA is $\{ q_0 \}$, as it is the epsilon closure of the start state of the NFA

Transition table:

| DFA state                        | $a$                              | $b$                       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| $\{q_{0}\}$                      | $\{q_{0}, q_{1}\}$               | $\{q_{0}\}$               |
| $\{q_{0}, q_{1}\}$               | $\{q_{0}, q_{1}, q_{2}\}$        | $\{q_{0},q_{2}\}$         |
| $\{q_{0}, q_{2}\}$               | $\{q_{0}, q_{1}, q_{3}\}$        | $\{q_{0},q_{3}\}$         |
| $\{q_{0}, q_{1}, q_{2}\}$        | $\{q_{0}, q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}\}$ | $\{q_{0}, q_{2}, q_{3}\}$ |
| $\{q_{0}, q_{3}\}$               | $\{q_{4}\}$                      | $\{q_{4}\}$               |
| $\{q_{0}, q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}\}$ | $\{q_{4}\}$                      | $\{q_{4}\}$               |
| $\{q_{4}\}$                      | $\{q_{4}\}$                      | $\{q_{4}\}$               |

The final state are any states that include $q_{3}$, which are $\{q_{0}, q_{1}, q_{2}, q_{3}\}$ and $\{q_{0}, q_{3}\}$.
