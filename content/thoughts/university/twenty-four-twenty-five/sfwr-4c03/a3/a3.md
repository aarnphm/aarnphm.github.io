>
> What is the IP address and TCP port number used by the client computer (source) that is transferring the file to www.cas.mcmaster.ca?

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-4c03/a3/q1-2.webp]]

- Source IP: `192.168.2.23`
- Source TCP port: 61278 and 61279

> [!question] 2

> What is the IP address of www.cas.mcmaster.ca? On what port number is it sending and receiving TCP segments for this connection?

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-4c03/a3/q2.webp]]

- IP: `130.113.68.10`
- Port: 80 for receiving and sending to the destination port (61278 and 61279 respectively)

> [!question] 3
>
> What is the actual sequence number of the TCP SYN segment that is used to initiate the TCP connection between the client computer and www.cas.mcmaster.ca? Which field in the segment identifies the segment as a SYN segment?

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-4c03/a3/q3.webp]]

The actual sequence number is 2792998522, which is defined under `Sequence Number (raw)` (or `tcp.seq_raw`)

> [!question] 4
>
> What is the actual sequence number of the SYNACK segment sent by www.cas.mcmaster.ca to the client computer in reply to the SYN? What is the value of the Acknowledgement number field in the SYNACK segment? How did www.cas.mcmaster.ca determine that value? Which field in the segment identifies the segment as a SYNACK segment?

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-4c03/a3/q4.webp]]

- Sequence number: 282123227
- ACK: 2792998523
- Determine that value by adding 1 to the sequence number of SYN package it received from the client:
  $$
  2792998522 + 1 = 2792998523
  $$
  _follows TCP rule where acknowledgement number is the next expected byte_
- Fields: "Flags: 0x012 (SYN, ACK)", which indicates both SYN and ACK bits are set.

1. First segment (Frame 428): 1159 bytes
   - Seq = 1 (contains the HTTP POST header)
2. Second segment (Frame 429): 1440 bytes
   - Seq = 1160
3. Third segment (Frame 430): 1440 bytes
   - Seq = 2600
4. Fourth segment (Frame 431): 1440 bytes

> [!question] 8
>
> What is the minimum amount of available buffer space advertised at the receiver for the entire trace? Does the lack of receiver buffer space ever throttle the sender?

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-4c03/a3/q8-buffer.webp]]

Minimum amount of available buffer space is 8192 bytes (Frame 436). Given from:

- Window field: 64
- scaling factor: 128
- calculated window size = $64 \times 128 = 8192$

Using same image from Q7, the advertised window sizes throughout the trace:

- Frame 436: Window = 64 (8192 bytes)
- Frame 437: Window = 86 (11008 bytes)
- Frame 438: Window = 109 (13952 bytes)
- Frame 439: Window = 132 (16896 bytes)
- Frame 456: Window = 154 (19712 bytes)
- Frame 457: Window = 177 (22656 bytes)

_Impact on Sender_

$\boxed{\text{No}}$

- smallest advertised window (8192 bytes) is still significantly larger than the segment being sent (1159-1440 bytes)
- Window size grows throughout the trace, indicating the receiver is processing data and making more buffer space available
- There are no segments in the trace that show the sender backing off or reducing its transmission rate due to window constraints.

Note that there are certain segment indicating the "TCP Window Full", which implies the buffer space did temporarily throttle the sender. However, it doesn't imply any specific packet loss.

> [!question] 9
>
> Are there any retransmitted segments in the trace file? What did you check for (in the trace) in order to answer this question?

Doesn't seem like there are any retransmitted segments in the trace file.

- Check Sequence Number if any sequence numbers were repeated (which indicate retransmission)
- Verify that the server acknowledged each segment in proper order.
- Didn't notice any "TCP Retransmission"
- The timing and transmission pattern suggests continuous flow of data without unusual delays.

> [!question] 10
>
> How much data does the receiver typically acknowledge in an ACK? Can you identify cases where the receiver is ACKing every other received segment (i.e., delayed ACK).

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-4c03/a3/q10.webp]]

In this trace, the receiver acknowledge **one segment per ACK** (refer to previous image)

From this trace, it doesn't suggest there are any delayed ACK (some ACKs acknowledged multiple segments at once)

> [!question] 11
>
> What is the throughput (bytes transferred per unit time) for the TCP connection? Explain how you arrived at this value.

- First segment (Frame 428): 1159 bytes
- Subsequent segments (Frames 429-431, 440-441): 5 segments × 1440 bytes = 7200 bytes
- Total data transferred: 1159 + 7200 = 8359 bytes

**Time interval:**

- First data packet timestamp (Frame 428): 3.482443 seconds
- Last ACK received (Frame 457): 3.503770 seconds
- Total transfer time: 3.503770 - 3.482443 = 0.021327 seconds

Throughput is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Throughput} &= \frac{\text{total bytes}}{\text{total time}} \\
&= \frac{8359 \text{ bytes}}{0.021327 \text{ second}} \\
&= 391944.48 \text{ bytes/second}
\end{aligned}
$$

The throughput for this TCP connection is: $\boxed{394 \text{ KB/s} = 3.152 \text{ Mbps}}$

## TCP Congestion Control

> [!question]
>
> Can you identify where TCP’s slow start phase begins and ends, and where congestion avoidance takes over? Comment on ways in which the measured data differs from the idealized behavior of TCP that we’ve studied in the text.

![[thoughts/university/twenty-four-twenty-five/sfwr-4c03/a3/congestion-control.webp]]

- slow start phase: starts at 0.92 seconds when the connection is established (initial phase roughly from 0.92 - 0.96 seconds), one can observe an exponential growth pattern in sequence number.
- transition point: around 0.96-0.965 second
- congestion starts from 0.965 onwards (growth becomes more linear) (step size more uniform in size)

_differences_:

- non-smooth growth pattern: Idealized TCP models show perfect exponential growth during slow start, but it shows irregularities and step patterns.
- Burstiness: We observe distinct "stepped" increases rather than smooth continuous growth (TCP sends data in bursts, i.e Poisson)
- UNclear transition point: on the graph, it is more gradual
- No visible congestion event: Doesn't show a clear packet loss that would normally trigger the shift to congestion avoidance (transition occurred because congestion window reached the slow start threshold value)
- Clustering of ACKs: The horizontal segments show how ACKs don't arrive at perfectly intervals (network jitter and buffering effects)
