Classified by:

- Level of System Detail

> [!abstract] static testing
>
> testing the ~code~ **system** _without_ executing it
>
> - detect defects early

> [!abstract] white box
>
> testing that _systematically_ exploit knowledge of the system to design tests for it
>
> - integrating an API
> - using a COTS product

> [!abstract] functional
>
> correctness can be sustained over continuous period of time, and test whether system perform its functions _correctly_
>
> - To find functional defects

> [!abstract] non-functional
>
> Testing how the system _perform_ (not what it does)
>
> - To find functional defects
