Reflecting on the recent final High Fidelity prototype and project reports for the Mosaic project, the standout experience was the collaboration within our team to create the Figma mock-up. Amid the hectic finals period and clashing schedules, we managed to agree on a minimal design. The asynchronous nature of our communication posed significant challenges; however, we pulled through successfully

The experience aligns with the course's components on advanced prototype. I did mentioned a design system that we can use to iterate upon our initial mock up of a school portal. However, due to everyone's time constraint, we decided to go with a more simple system, which is shown in reports. This is similar to what I did during my co-op term in San Francisco, where I partake in the design of our SAAS product. It also include a web portals to enable access to our platforms for users, somewhat similar to the Mosaic improvement project. Therefore, it have a lot of similarity and inspiration from my past work.

A point that resonates with me a lot is our emphasis on accessibility and extensibility. I want to make sure that strong colour contrast and readable text are visible in the mock-up to align with accessibility standards. Additionally, the ability to add personalised items for student centre is powerful, allowing students to make Mosaic their own. Therefore, I will always think about extensible design in my future work.

There are several actionable takeaways for future work. Firstly, recognising importance of a design system, I will continue advocating for one that balances complexity and simplicity, allowing for flexibility within time constraints. I will continue to emphasise for modular design that supports growth and diversification. Lastly, the commitment to accessibility and personalisation will remain at the forefront of my designs, ensuring they are not only compliant with standards but also deeply user-centric, allowing for individual customisation and fostering a sense of ownership among users. This experience has solidified my resolve to pursue extensibility and inclusivity design, qualities that I believe are indispensable in creating meaningful and lasting user experiences.
