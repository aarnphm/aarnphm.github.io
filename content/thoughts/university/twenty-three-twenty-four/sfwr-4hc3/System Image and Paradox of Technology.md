[[thoughts/university/twenty-three-twenty-four/hci-4hc3/Psychopathology of everything#Fundamental principles of Interaction]] goes into the fundamentals of interaction when designing a product -> conceptual models

- People create mental models of themselves, environment, interaction
- Designer conceptual model vs. Users conceptual models

> What does it takes to create a good conceptual models?

> - Users study?
> - Low-fidelity prototype

Paradox of technology
The same technology that simplifies life by providing more functions in each device also complicates life by making the device harder to learn, harder to us

Design challenges

- Price
- features parity
- reliability
- supports
