- larger ranges in managerial jobs reflect the greater opportunity for performance variants in the work
- firm uses percentiles as maximum and minimums while other establish them separately.

> pay disparity among candidates.

- recognize performance pay difference with pay
- expectations pay over time

2. External pressures

- difference in productivity or value variations
- mix of pay forms

#### range overlap

Overlap ought to be large enough to induce employees to seek promotions.

- flexibility
- career growth
