title: Job-based Pay structures and Job Evaluation

See [[thoughts/university/twenty-three-twenty-four/commerce-4be3/Job-based Pay Structures and Job Evaluation.pdf|slides]]

## Speakers

- ask better questions
- need to know what you want the compensation philosophy
  - what is the purpose of the compensation plan?
  - are we still doing this correct?
  - questions this philosophy?
- ask hard problems, questions
- internet is not a good salary source
- Good communication and understand what your compensation philosophy is
- Keys:
  - Jobs and hierarchy they brings
  - skills and competencies they offer
- Documents and version control it.
- Subjective and Bias builtin
- Research the roles within the jobs.

## Job Evaluation

> systematically determining the relative worth of jobs to create job structure within an organisation

> based on combination of job content, skills, values, organisation culture, external market

Decision:

- purpose
- single or multiple plans
- among alternative approaches
- involvement of relevant stakeholders
- evaluate usefulness

## establish purpose

aligned if

- supports organisation strategy
- supports workflow
- fair to employees
- motivates behaviour toward organisation objectives.

## single vs. multiple plans

- evaluation plans for different types of workflow
- number of job evaluation plans _depends_ on how detailed it needs to be to make pay decisions

## choices of job evaluation

### simple ranking.

- order from highest to lowest based on relative values
- advantages: simple, fast, easy to understand and explain to employees; least expensive initially.
- disadvantages:
  - ranking criteria is poorly defined -> evaluations become biased
  - evaluators must be knowledgeable about all jobs
  - results are difficult to defend and costly solutions maybe be required.

| alternatives methods | description                                                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alternation          | order descriptions alternately at each extreme, evaluators agree on which jobs are the most valuable |
| Paired comparison    | compare each job with every other job, number of comparisons = n(n-1)/2                              |

### classification

- series of classes cover the range of jobs
- descriptions are labels which capture general nature of work

## point method

- assignment of numeric score
- procedure results in a relative ordering of jobs based on the number of points that each job "scores".

### 1. Job Analysis

- representative benchmark jobs is drawn for analysis

### 2. Determine Compensable Factors

- based on strategy and values of organisation
- based on the work performed
- acceptable to stakeholders affected by the resulting pay structure

challenges:

- small numbers
- unique criteria

### 3. Scale the Factors

- 4 to 8 degrees

### 4. Weigh the Factors

- of important
- weights reflect the relative importance of each Factors
- determined through an advisory committee (a priori judgement approach)

### 5 & 6. Communicate.

Who?

- employees
- consultants
- union representatives

### Design process and Job structures

provides a hierarchy of work, or a job structure

## Skill-based plans

- in the trade
- link pay to the depth or breath of skills
- pay individuals for all relevant skills -> wage attach to person

### types.

1. depth

- based on knowledge of the person

2. generalist/breadth

- increased by acquiring new knowledge

> [!important] Purpose of skill-based
> supports organisation's strategy, workflow, fair to employees, and motivates behaviour

### Outcomes

- well accepted by employees and provide strong motivation for individuals to increase new skills
- become increasingly expensive
- flexibility permits leaner staff
- success is determined by how well it aligns

## Competency-based plans

- faireness and motivations

- skill-based, foundation for successful work
- core competencies are often linked to the mission statement
- competency set translates core -> action
- indicators are observable behaviour

### Analysis

- core competencies are not unique for each company
- differs applies their competencies
- verify their possession of that competency
- no objective way to certifying competencies
- relatively few levels and wide differentials for increased levels

## internal alignment reflected in structures

- purposed of job and person-based procedures is to design and manage a pay structure.

## reliability and validity

- consultants
- improve reliability by using evaluators familiar with the work and trained in job evaluation.
- validity refers to degree the evaluation assesses relative job worth.

## Acceptability

- formal appeals process -> request and re-analysis or skills re-evaluation.
- employee attitude surveys assess perceptions of how useful evaluation is as a management tools.

## bias.

To ensure bias-free evaluation:

- compensable factors and scales to include the content of jobs
- factor weights are consistently biased against jobs
- apply the plan as bias free a manner as feasible.
