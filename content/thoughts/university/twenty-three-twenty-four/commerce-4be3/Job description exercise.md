4BE3 Job Description Assignment

<!-- Olivia Santos, Aaron Pham, Marley Hourigan  -->

Factor 1 – Knowledge/Education/Training

We agree with the Level 3 decision because the types of duties required of the Customer Service Representative are quite heavy and a person who is still in high school may not fully be able to grasp these ideas or fully understand how to do them.

Factor 2 – Skill Gained by Experience

We agree with the Level 3 decision (over 3 months and including 6 months) because these tasks may take a bit more time to learn and require more training and support with them. Employee probation is usually done after 3 months so they should be able to do these tasks on their own by that point with minimal support.

Factor 3 – Responsibility for Decisions and Skill in Operations

We think that Factor 3 should be increased to a Level 4 because the employee has decision-making authority over refunds and payments, and also needs to pay close attention to inventory and ordering to ensure everything is ordered in a timely manner. They need to also manage multiple programs.

Factor 4 – Responsibility for Ingenuity and Creativity

We agree with the Level 2 decision because the role does not require too much creativity other than the occasional thinking on the spot and coming up with solutions, but these solutions will not be implemented company wide.
