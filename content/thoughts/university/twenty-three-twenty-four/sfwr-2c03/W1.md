> algorithm = takes one-or-more values, produces an outputs

Ex: `contains`

> Given a list of $L$ and value $v$, return $v \in L.$

Input: $L$ is an array, $v$ is a value
Output: true if $v \in L$, false otherwise

```prolog
i, r := 0, false
while i neq |L| do
  if L[i] = v then
    r := true
    i := i + 1
  else
    i := i + 1
return r
```

## invariants

> Induction hypothesis that holds at beginning of iteration.

[[thoughts/Determinism|Deterministic]]

1. Base case: `inv` holds before the loop
2. Hypothesis: holds after `j-th, j<m` repetition of loop
3. Step: assume `inv` holds when start `m-th` loop, proves it holds again at the end of `m-th` loop

Are we done?

- Assuming invariant -> does it reach conclusion
- Does it end?

Formal argument: prove a bound function

_bound function $f$_ on the state of the algorithm such that the output of $f$

- _natural number_ (0, 1, 2, ...)
- _strictly decreases_ after each iteration

$f=|L| - i$ starts at $|L|, |L| \geq 0$

## correctness.

1. _pre-condition_: restriction require on input
2. _post-condition_: should the output be
3. prove the _running the program_ turns _pre-condition_ and _post-condition_

## complexity.

_assume V is not in the list_
`Contains(N)` = 5 + 7N

_given V is in the list_

> `contains` is correct, runtime complexity is $\text{ContainsRuntime(|L|)}=|L|$ and memory complexity is $\text{ContainsMemory(|L|)}=1$

### runtime.

models are simplification.

shows different growth rates.

> Interested in scalability of algorithm
> _For large enough inputs, `contains` will always be faster than `altc` because **order of growth** of $\text{CRuntime} < \text{AltCRuntime}$_
