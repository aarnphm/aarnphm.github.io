### features.

$$
H = \frac{k_BT}{\omega m_H g}
$$

1. solid or dash
   solid q

2. larger mean molecular weights?
   B: shallow features => higher mean molecular weights

mass-metallicity trend

> [!question]
> Can we detect clouds in exoplanets?

Clouds suppress atmospheric chemical signatures

> [!important]
> Introduced a degeneracy between ==cloud-top pressure== and ==mean molecular weight==

### clouds/winds on giant planets.

Wind cells

Hadley cells

> [!note] Coriolis Effect
> Winds do not follow a straight trajectory
### Winds on tidally-locked exoplanets
