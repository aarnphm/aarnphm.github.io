### Atmospheric escape

> _non-thermal escape_: A physical process that results in the full or partial loss of a planet's atmosphere.

**large-scale magnetic fields**

- conductive material
- convective motion
- has kinetic energy

> Mars doesn't have convective interior, since the core has been cooled off.
>
> radioactive decay within the core

### Stellar winds

continuous flow of _ionized particles_ emitted by the Sun and other stars.

#### Charge exchange

### Thermal escape

#### Jeans escape

Given the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the probability of a particle having a certain velocity is given by:

$$
\left( \frac{dN}{dv} \right)_{m,T} = v^2 \left( \frac{m}{2 \pi k_B T} \right)^{\frac{3}{2}} \exp \left( -\frac{mv^2}{2k_BT} \right)
$$
