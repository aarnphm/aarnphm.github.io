title: Epicurus

[[thoughts/university/twenty-three-twenty-four/philo-1aa3/Socrates|Socrates]] ideas:

- care for self -> happiness and virtue are problems of knowledge
- Idealism: Being is Idea; fundamental reality is immaterial, spiritual, and rational
- Never by itself lead anyone astray

Epicurus

- Emphasize the value of philosophy as care of the self.
- Deny Idealism, affirm matterialism in the form of atomism

## Desire

> completely innocent, if it goes wrong because of its belief

May be necessary or not necessary

### Necessary

_non-satisfaction brings pain_

- Happiness (philosophy, friends)
- Life (food, water)
- Untroubled body (law, leisure)

### Not necessary

_non-satisfaction not necessarily painful. Any pain of non-satisfaction relieved by other means (change one's opinion about the object)_

- Natural (sex, immortality)
- Conventional (reputation)

## The notoriety of Epicurus

- materialism, denying the spiritual in nature
- belief in chance and no final purpose
- disbelief in afterlife
- hedonism: pleasure is the highest good

## Idea of Pleasure

- A feeling, not a sensation
- An evaluation of sensation
- Pleasure and pain are distinct qualities, like the two poles of a magnet. Neither is merely the lack of the other

## Pleasure

### Kinetic

_depends on an object and is intermittent or discontinuous_
Shadowed by pain
Excess -> produce pain

### Katastematic

_Continuous, independent of external objects._
Types:

- _Aponia_: leisure, physical ease, stressless well-being
- _Ataraxia_: untroubled, tranquil mind

Un-quantified terms

_Reasons for promoting pleasure as *the highest good*_

1. Cradle Argument
   The goodness of pleasure is learned in the cradle. The first good, naturally pursued
2. Conceptual Argument
   Concept of good becomes meaningless when conceived as independent of pleasure

> The more obstructive, unpersuasive the definition comes

## Plato's Against Pleasure as the Good

- Pleasure is the replenishment of lack
- Life spent in pursuit of pleasure constantly tries to fullfill newly arising lack
- Any pleasure is made better by adding virtue. - Pleasure plus wisdom is better than pleasure without wisdom - Pleasure plus courage is better than pleasure without courage
  > So pleasure cannot be the highest good

=> Answer of Epicurus:

> Wisdom, courage, and all the virtues _are_ katastematic pleasures

Higher and lower hedonism

## Virtues

> [!NOTE]
> Personal qualities that assist us in the pursuit of happiness

Katastematic

Virtues according to Epicurus

### Prudence, practical wisdom

Truly prudence have knowledge of kinetic pleasure
=> whether to choose or avoid it => never interfere with their katastematic pleasure

Successful life =: uncanny unsucessful life in the eye of the world
Aim for self-sufficiency, cultivate leisures, prefer private life, private pleasure, low-profile

Learn to live in the little -> circumstances changes => make due with less

### Self-sufficiency

### Frugality

Less toy => more katastematic pleasure
Wealth shouldn't be the most important

Doesn't advocate poverty -> invokes how we think wealth in a new way
Wealth is not money, but the mean to enjoy life

> Wealth is an abundant of katastematic pleasures

Basis in nature => easy to apply

### Friendship

Being a friend, having friend => support katastematic pleasures

Awareness among friends that they _are not alone_
Sense of security := katastematic pleasure of virtues

### Justice

Can't be happy when act unjust

=> Epicurus believes in social contract.

Human lives without any organisation

1st Civilisation: Agreement to prevent harm among themselves

- Why?: Motives is not fear, but the desire for friendship. Unpleasant to prepare to fight at every moment
  -> Violence is not a way of life

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Justice and pleasures are fundamental building blocks of society

Saw the needs for more formal definition of contract => Law and Justice

> Justice is neither natural nor sheer conventional. Originated from conventional, but the motive is natural (pleasure of security and friendship)

- Justice is an conventional good contrived to promote pleasure
- Not eternal. Justice changes as circumstances change
- Not inherently good. Good as a means to the higher end of pleasure.

## Challenge to Religion

- Our world is one of infinite worlds in endless void
- Nothing spiritual in nature. Human beings not special in nature. They are animals, system of matter, like everything else. Death is extinction.
- The gods takes no interest in human affairs and cannot be moved by sacrifice or prayer.
- Religious ceremonies are superstitious. They are the way a powerful few control the rest. The aim of philosophy is to liberate people from superstition.

## Tetrapharmakos

_The four-fold remedy_

- The gods present no fears
- Death presents no worry
- The good is readily attainable
- The terrible is readily endurable
