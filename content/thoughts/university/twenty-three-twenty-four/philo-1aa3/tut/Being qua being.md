---

# Wisdom

- Most general knowledge
- Not instrumental knowledge
  - Practical (Techne) -> practical
  - Epistemic (Episteme) -> theoretical

> Aristotle values episteme, since Techne is dependent on others

    Theoretical is independent of others scenarios

Intrinsic values of epistemology?

Instrumental values only relatable once intrinsic values are considered
-> intrinsic values over instrumental values

- Since of being (`being qua being`) => is it possible scientifically?
- Philosophy of science
  - How do we justify science is possible?
    - Unify principle to account for the variety of things
- Questions wrt metaphysics
  - Science of metaphysics to study everything (study of being)

Being has a lot of sense

# Passage

_Bk. 4 Ch. 2 (p. 135)_

Priority of Substances

Focal point

Healthy -> functional relativity to 'health'

Using health or different aspect of health

That is being is related to one central point

all things to be that are of substances,

- affections
- process
- destruction/privations/qualities
- productive

if there is a science for one -> a science for all?

Metaphysics is a science for investigating

What is the focal point of metaphysics?

What is the primary sense of being?

> Primary sense of being is being substances

Substances is an unified things in the world

ex: Human is a substances
