title: Allegory of the cave, Republic
---

Allegory of the cave:

- See the shadow, but not the reflection of the real world
- Escape the prisoner -> convince them to go out and see what the real world is
- Talking about shadow (escape to identify real world now instead of the shadow)

### Republic pp. 124-125

State of Ignorance?

State of being in the cave = Ignorance

eyesight => capacity for learning

Sun = knowledge, intelligible world

shadow -> sensible world

> taints these visions are unwilling to decent to human affair for the => which desire for allegory (don't want to go down to the cape)

Fear of the unknown?

Journey to Enlightenment?

Enlightenment as a duty?

Why most of them don't want to escape at the beginning?
Why only one of them to escape? -> fear of the unknown?

The form?
