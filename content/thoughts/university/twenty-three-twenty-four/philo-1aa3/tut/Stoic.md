- opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion

What we can't control: belongs to others

- property, reputation, command, body

> Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, repu-tation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.
