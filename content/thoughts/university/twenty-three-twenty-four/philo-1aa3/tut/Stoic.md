### Epictetus - Enchiridion

What we can control: belongs to us

- opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion

What we can't control: belongs to others

- property, reputation, command, body

<p align='center'><b>Concern for care for self</b></p>

> Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, repu-tation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.

| IN our control                      | NOT in our control               |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Action/pursuit (inflect reputation) | Reputation (perceived by others) |
| Acting on desire                    | Feeling of desire                |

> Epictetus saying that you can train of the feeling of desire.
