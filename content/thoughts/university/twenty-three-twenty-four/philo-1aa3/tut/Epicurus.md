title: Epicurus's Hedonism and Materialism
---

# Materialism

- made of atoms

# Central role of chance

# Denial of afterlife

- believes in gods and souls, but souls are _material of thing_
- souls dies once the body dies

# Hedonism

- pleasure as the highest good

Q:

- Why is pleasure the highest good?
- Which pleasures should we choose?
- Agree?

Pleasure - Pain
(good) (bad)

Blessed life
=> healthy body
=> undisturbed soul lead to pleasure

    Endure pain for greater pleasure

Kinetic vs. Katastematic pleasure
object dependent vs. object independent
