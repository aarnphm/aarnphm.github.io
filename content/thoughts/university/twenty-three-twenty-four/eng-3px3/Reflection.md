What?

The problems we were asked include whether we out-source or develop the robots to create prefab in-house. Additionally, we were asked about whether the electrical work are being done within the factories or on-site.

So What?

We then clarify that we are going to only focus on creating the pre-configured sets of housing components, such as walls, pilers, etc. Electrical works are still needed at the construction site as workers would be present to finalize the house.

With regards to robots, we initially looked at developing robots in-house, but given that we have factored in R&D, it could be more beneficial for faster go-to-market timeline to out-source such robots. We will also have to additionally look into what are the offerings within the market for automations and robotics equipments.

Additionally, general feedback with costs consists of the need to consider the future market for timeline, costs for variations of concretes, additional factors that could influence margin changes.

Now What?

We will need to figure out the target of our R&D to decide whether we should build robots in-house or out-source.

We should keep 50% to 50% for sensitivity analysis, as we are not sure of the future market for timeline.
