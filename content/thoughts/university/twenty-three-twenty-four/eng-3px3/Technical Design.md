> technical analysis: Using science to determine how variables are related in order to draw conclusions in engineering-relevant context

- Licensing is not discipline-specific

### terms.

1. Decision variables:

- could change about the design

2. Performance parameters

- describes how well the realised design works that is relevant to the end users
- can't control performance parameters directly

### optimum engineering design.

1. use **technical analysis** to determine decision variables
2. write **NVF** in terms of _decision variables_
3. use **optimisation methods** to determine

- optimum set of decision variables
- corresponding value of NVF
- sensitive the optimum set and resulting NVF are to changes in decision variables and other parameters

### validity and assumptions:

- push to one extreme
