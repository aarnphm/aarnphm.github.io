What?

The problems we were asked include whether we out-source or develop the robots to create prefab in-house. Additionally, we were asked about whether the electrical work are being done within the factories or on-site.

So What?

We then clarify that we are going to only focus on creating the pre-configured sets of housing components, such as walls, pilers, etc. Electrical works are still needed at the construction site as workers would be present to finalize the house.

With regards to robots, we initially looked at developing robots in-house, but given that we have factored in R&D, it could be more beneficial for faster go-to-market timeline to out-source such robots. We will also have to additionally look into what are the offerings within the market for automations and robotics equipments.

Additionally, general feedback with costs consists of the need to consider the future market for timeline, costs for variations of concretes, additional factors that could influence margin changes.

Now What?

We will need to figure out the target of our R&D to decide whether we should build robots in-house or out-source.

We should keep 50% to 50% for sensitivity analysis, as we are not sure of the future market for timeline.

Our design project focused on exploring prefab housing automation as a potential solution to address the housing shortage in Ontario. I worked with Karol Lukowski, Dexter Holst, Liam Walker on this project. My main contribution is related to looking at the automation software for embedded system for controlling these robots, creating detailed NVF as well as conversion factors. Karol worked on the technical analysis overview, risk management. Liam focused on sensitivity analysis, final recommendations, and Dexter worked on sensitivity analysis, change log, solution comparison, optimization and NPV. Through this project, I hoped to gain a deeper understanding of how to apply economic principles such as sensitivity analysis, NPV and financial analysis to evaluate the feasibility of an engineering solution of a prefab housing automation. I didn't feel equipped with this project whatsoever, since it was a completely different topics that I would ever worked on. Mainly I worked on a software-as-a-product service, so working on embedded system and software for a civil-based project often provide a shallow window to work on it. Lectures provides good enough introduction into economic concepts, but it didn't really help with a lot of the analysis for the project in terms of software, since prefab mainly concerns mechatronics and civil, which are the other team members discipline. I wasn't able to partake in a lot of design studio session due to health-specific reasons, so I definitely found it difficult on finding way to contribute meaningfully to the project. I did think that the project went well, since all Karol, Dexter, Liam seemed to be very passionate about the project, and I did try to ask how I can help them, but often time I found it hard to grasp my full usefulness with the project. I fully understand that it would affect my mark, but at the end of the day I did want to learn more about economics, but I yet to find it useful with these concepts. I did find learning about Net Value function encapsulates problem definition and do put in what are the scope of the problem is. It did met my expectation given that I couldn't contribute much to the project, simply there was barely anything related to software that I can really do. For next time, I would definitely try to find a problem that I can use my expertise a bit more for a different problem where it utilize a bit more software. I think that I can make reasonable assumptions or perform necessary research to cope with ambiguity in the required tasks, as well as apply some fundamental of cost, price and present value in the ILO metrics that I found I do achieve. I realize that I can't really utilize economic principles to make decisions simply because I don't know enough technical details in terms of civil and mechatronics aspects, thus it was hard for me to apply what we learnt in class.
