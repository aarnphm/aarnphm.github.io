### Marginal analysis

> determining the impact of a decision on net value,
> especially when the decision is incremental (e.g., change in NV with one more orange)

### Sensitivity analysis

> how sensitive the model (i.e., NVF) is to changes in its
> inputs or parameters (like conversion factors).

= marginal analysis for each variable separately and comparing the results.
