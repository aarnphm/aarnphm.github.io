The idea of philosophical skepticism can also be investigated from {{sidenotes[ordinary skepticism]: for example, we aren't sure how many stars there are in the Milky Way. In a sense, this kind of skepticism claims that we do not know propositions which we ordinary think we do know.}}

From this example two points:

- most of us don't believe in such proposition, therefore knowledge requires {{sidenotes[beliefs]: beliefs and disbeliefs are called [[thoughts/doxastic attitude]] that we can adopt towards a proposition.}}
- even those believe do not know it, because they aren't ::justified:: in believing in it, therefore knowledge requires _justification_.

The recommendation is that we can either adopt the doxastic attitude towards the proposition, but philosophers would hold a _third_ attitude (i.e bona fide doxastic attitude) towards a proposition: _we can suspend judgment (or withhold assent) with respect to it._

There is a sensitivity arguments when targeting knowledge, where it is a ::condition:: on knowledge.
