Mary lives in a black-and-white room. She's a brilliant neuroscientist who studies color vision. She knows every physical and functional fact about color perception: wavelengths, photoreceptor responses, neural pathways, cortical processing, behavioral dispositions. Complete physical/functional knowledge.

One day she leaves the room and sees a red tomato. She learns something new: what red _looks like_. The phenomenal character of red experience. The quale.

If she learns something new, she didn't know everything before. But she knew all the physical/functional facts. Therefore there are facts beyond physical/functional facts—phenomenal facts. Therefore physicalism (and [[thoughts/functionalism]]) is false.

This is Frank Jackson's knowledge argument. [@jackson1982epiphenomenalqualia; @jackson1986whatmary]

## the argument structure

1. **Complete physical knowledge**: Mary knows all physical facts about color vision (neural mechanisms, functional roles, causal relations, behavioral dispositions).

2. **Learning something new**: When Mary sees red, she learns what red experiences are like. She gains new knowledge.

3. **Knowledge implies fact**: If she learns something, there's some fact she didn't know before. (Knowledge is factive—you can't know what isn't true.)

4. **Therefore non-physical facts exist**: The fact she learns (what red is like) isn't a physical fact. She knew all those. It's a phenomenal fact—a fact about [[thoughts/qualia|conscious experience]].

5. **Therefore physicalism is false**: If there are non-physical facts, physicalism is false. Mind isn't exhausted by physical/functional properties.

The argument generalizes beyond color. Substitute any phenomenal experience: pain, taste, smell, emotional feelings. If complete physical knowledge leaves phenomenal knowledge out, physicalism is incomplete.

## what exactly does Mary learn?

Three options:

**She learns a new fact.** There's some proposition she didn't know before and now knows: "red experiences have phenomenal character R." This proposition is about a non-physical property. [@jackson1982epiphenomenalqualia]

Problem: inflates ontology. Now you have physical properties (wavelengths, neural firings) and phenomenal properties (qualia). How do they relate? Causal interaction seems impossible (how does non-physical affect physical?). Epiphenomenalism: phenomenal properties are caused by physical but don't cause anything. Makes consciousness explanatorily idle.

**She gains a new ability.** Not propositional knowledge (knowing-that) but practical knowledge (knowing-how). She gains abilities: recognize red, remember red, imagine red. [@lewis1988know; @nemirow1990physicalism]

Problem: seems to change the subject. When she sees red, she doesn't just acquire abilities—she has a revelation. "So _that's_ what red is like." The phenomenal character is what she discovers, not just that she can now do certain things. And some abilities (recognize, compare) require knowing what red is like—so ability can't explain the knowledge, it presupposes it.

**She knows the same facts under new modes of presentation.** Old knowledge: physical/functional description of red experiences. New knowledge: phenomenal concept of red experiences. Same facts, different ways of grasping them. Like knowing "water" and "H₂O"—same substance, different concepts. [@loar1990phenomenal]

Problem: why can't she derive the phenomenal concept from physical knowledge? With "water" and "H₂O," empirical investigation reveals the identity. With physical descriptions and phenomenal experience, no amount of investigation closes the gap. She could know everything about neural states and never predict "this is what red feels like." The epistemic gap seems to track a metaphysical gap.

## responses and counter-responses

**Old fact, new mode (phenomenal concepts).** Mary knows fact F₁: "state S₁ responds to 650nm wavelengths and causes reports of 'red.'" After leaving, she knows fact F₂: "experiences with phenomenal character R are caused by tomatoes." But F₁ = F₂ (same physical state, same functional role). She just grasps it via different concept: physical/functional vs phenomenal. [@loar1990phenomenal]

Phenomenal concepts are special: direct, recognitional, not descriptive. You grasp phenomenal character by instantiating it, not by knowing causal role. That's why she can't derive phenomenal knowledge from physical knowledge—the concepts work differently. But there's no metaphysical gap, just epistemic gap between concept types.

Reply: this requires brute necessities—metaphysically necessary connections between physical and phenomenal that aren't a priori derivable. Unlike standard identity statements (water = H₂O), where empirical investigation explains the necessity, the physical-phenomenal link remains unexplained. Why _this_ neural state feels like _this_? The phenomenal concept strategy labels the problem but doesn't solve it. [@chalmers1996consciousmind]

**Ability hypothesis.** Mary doesn't learn new facts—she gains new abilities. She can now: recognize red things, imagine red, remember red experiences, compare red to other colors. These are practical capacities, not propositional knowledge. [@lewis1988know; @nemirow1990physicalism]

Reply: the abilities require knowing what red is like. You can't recognize red without knowing its phenomenal character. And when she first sees red, the revelation isn't "I can now do X, Y, Z"—it's "so _this_ is what red is like." The phenomenal knowledge seems prior to, or at least distinct from, the abilities. Plus: she could acquire some abilities in the room (via description: "red is the experience caused by tomatoes, distinct from blue..."). The abilities she gains outside track phenomenal knowledge, don't replace it. [@alter2007ability]

**Mary doesn't know everything physical.** Complete physical knowledge would include knowledge by acquaintance with physical states—actually instantiating them. She knows physical descriptions but hasn't instantiated the neural states of seeing red. When she leaves, she gains knowledge by acquaintance. Still physical knowledge, just different kind. [@churchland1985knowing]

Reply: "knowledge by acquaintance" with neural states is just phenomenal knowledge by another name. The whole question is whether instantiating physical/functional state explains phenomenal character. Relabeling phenomenal knowledge as "acquaintance with physical" doesn't resolve the issue—it presupposes physicalism instead of arguing for it. [@jackson1986whatmary]

**Knowledge isn't factive here.** When Mary says "I learned what red is like," she's not acquiring new facts. She's having new experiences. Experience isn't knowledge—it's acquaintance, revelation, transformation. No new fact, so no argument against physicalism. [@churchland1985knowing]

Reply: but she clearly knows something new. Ask her: "What is it like to see red?" Before: "I can tell you all the neural mechanisms but not the phenomenal character." After: "It's _like this_" (forms phenomenal concept). That's knowledge—not just having experience but knowing what the experience is like. You can have experiences without knowing what they're like (inattentive, fleeting, confused experiences). Mary gains both experience and knowledge. [@alter2007ability]

## Jackson's later rejection

Here's the twist: Jackson eventually rejected his own argument. [@jackson1998argument] His turnaround:

The phenomenal concept strategy convinced him. Physical/functional facts determine phenomenal facts, but phenomenal concepts are epistemically special—require direct instantiation. Mary learns nothing metaphysically new, just grasps old facts via new concepts.

Why accept this? Because epiphenomenalism (the alternative) is intolerable. If phenomenal properties don't cause anything, they're evolutionarily idle. Selection can't favor consciousness if consciousness doesn't affect behavior. And our knowledge of our own phenomenal states would be miraculous—how do we know about properties that don't cause our knowledge? [@jackson1998argument]

Physicalism has problems (the explanatory gap, the hard problem), but non-physicalism has worse problems (interaction, evolution, epistemic access). So embrace physicalism and explain away the intuition.

Not everyone followed Jackson. Many think the intuition stands: Mary learns something genuinely new, and phenomenal concepts can't explain it away. The debate continues.

## phenomenal concepts

The phenomenal concept strategy is the main physicalist response now. The idea: physical/functional facts determine all facts, but our cognitive access to those facts varies. Physical concepts: third-person, descriptive, theoretical. Phenomenal concepts: first-person, recognitional, demonstrative. [@loar1990phenomenal]

You can't derive phenomenal concepts from physical concepts because concept types differ—not because facts differ. Like knowing Superman and Clark Kent: same person, epistemic gap between concepts. The gap is in how you grasp the facts, not in the facts.

But the disanalogy: empirical investigation reveals Superman = Clark Kent. No investigation reveals "C-fibers firing = pain quale." The identity remains brute—necessary but inexplicable. [@chalmers1996consciousmind]

Physicalists bite the bullet: some necessities are brute. That's a theoretical cost, but cheaper than dualism or epiphenomenalism. Anti-physicalists say: brute necessities aren't really necessities—they're evidence the identity doesn't exist. The debate is metaphysical, not just conceptual.

## Mary and [[thoughts/functionalism]]

The knowledge argument targets physicalism, but it applies directly to [[thoughts/functionalism]]. Mary knows all functional facts about color vision (causal roles, input/output mappings, computational processes). She still learns something new. Therefore phenomenal knowledge isn't functional knowledge.

Functionalists respond with ability hypothesis (she gains functional capacities, not knowledge) or expanded functional roles (phenomenal properties are part of the functional role, she just couldn't grasp them without instantiating the role). [@levin2024functionalism]

But this faces the standard problem: if phenomenal properties are part of functional role, inverted spectrum cases (see [[thoughts/inverted spectrum]]) are impossible—different phenomenal character means different functional role. That blocks multiple realization: you can't have same mental state (pain, red-experience) with different phenomenal character. Many think that's too restrictive. Mental kinds are multiply realizable; phenomenal character varies orthogonally to functional role.

## contemporary angles

**[[thoughts/LLMs]] and phenomenal knowledge.** Could an LLM know what red is like? It can learn all the physical/functional facts (training on color science textbooks). But without visual experience, it seems to lack phenomenal knowledge—same epistemic position as room-bound Mary.

Now show the LLM images during training (multimodal models). Does it gain phenomenal knowledge? Or just more behavioral/functional capacities (classify colors, generate appropriate descriptions)?

The knowledge argument says: functional/behavioral capacities aren't phenomenal knowledge. You need first-person experience. But if phenomenal experience just is certain kind of functional organization (complex integration, self-monitoring, attention), then sufficiently rich AI systems might have it.

No consensus. Your view on AI consciousness tracks your view on the knowledge argument: if Mary learns something beyond physical/functional facts, so does phenomenal knowledge require something beyond functional organization. If the ability hypothesis works, functional capacities might suffice.

**Mechanistic interpretability.** When we decompose [[thoughts/LLMs|neural networks]], we find functional features: "this direction represents color," "this circuit tracks RGB values." [@geiger2025causalabstraction] Complete functional story—but nothing about what it's like (if anything) for the model to process color.

This is Mary's epistemic situation. You can know the functional architecture completely and still not know phenomenal character (if present). The knowledge argument predicts this: functional knowledge doesn't entail phenomenal knowledge.

Of course, if there's no phenomenal knowledge (if functionalism is true and phenomenal talk is just confused), then the completeness of functional explanation is expected. Either way, mechanistic interpretability won't tell you about consciousness—it's orthogonal to the functional story.

**Clinical applications.** Patients with blindsight: visual information processing (functional capacities: avoid obstacles, guess object properties better than chance) without visual experience. They have Mary's room-bound knowledge—functional facts about vision—but lack phenomenal knowledge (what it's like to see).

Restore phenomenal vision (via neural intervention, therapy, spontaneous recovery): they gain what Mary gains. Not new functional capacities (they already had those in degraded form), but phenomenal character. The dissociation supports the argument: functional knowledge ≠ phenomenal knowledge.

## the explanatory gap

The knowledge argument is really just the explanatory gap in epistemic form. [@levine1983materialism] Why can't we explain phenomenal character in physical/functional terms? Why can't Mary derive "red looks like this" from complete physical knowledge?

The gap has two readings:

**Epistemic gap**: our concepts, cognitive limitations, or explanatory frameworks can't bridge physical and phenomenal. Not a metaphysical problem—a cognitive problem. Maybe future neuroscience or conceptual innovations will close it. [@loar1990phenomenal]

**Metaphysical gap**: phenomenal properties are genuinely distinct from physical/functional properties. No amount of conceptual progress will close the gap because there's nothing to close—the properties don't reduce. [@chalmers1996consciousmind]

The knowledge argument pushes toward the second reading. Mary has complete physical knowledge—nothing cognitive is missing. She's not limited by bad concepts or ignorance. Yet the gap remains. Suggests the gap is in the world, not our knowledge of it.

Physicalists deny this. Complete physical knowledge does include phenomenal knowledge—Mary just can't access it without instantiation. Not a gap in the world but in our epistemic situation. The argument equivocates between "knowing all physical facts" (having complete physical theory) and "knowing all physical facts in all ways" (grasping facts via all possible concepts, including phenomenal). She has the first, not the second.

## where this leaves us

The knowledge argument: either a devastating problem for physicalism/functionalism, or a confusion about knowledge and concepts, or an intuition pump that loses force when you see through it.

If Mary genuinely learns new facts, and those facts aren't physical/functional, then phenomenal consciousness is additional to physical/functional organization. [[thoughts/functionalism]] is incomplete at best, false at worst. Qualia are real and irreducible.

If Mary gains new abilities or new modes of grasping old facts, the argument fails. Physical/functional facts exhaust the facts. Phenomenal concepts are special epistemically but not metaphysically. Functionalism can be saved.

The debate turns on: what is knowledge? What are facts? Can same fact be grasped in metaphysically distinct ways? These are hard questions in epistemology and metaphysics, not just philosophy of mind.

Practical stakes: if phenomenal knowledge is distinct from functional knowledge, then complete functional understanding of brain/AI systems won't tell you about consciousness. You need additional evidence, criteria, or theory. If phenomenal knowledge reduces to functional knowledge (via abilities or concepts), then functional analysis is sufficient. Mechanistic understanding is complete understanding.

Mary's revelation: either evidence that consciousness transcends the physical, or evidence that knowing and experiencing are different modes of accessing the same physical facts. Pick your interpretation carefully—the knowledge argument is still doing work.
