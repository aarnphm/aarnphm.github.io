> That feeling when you want to text that person back, but you are too nervous about why they didn't then you started forming up scenarios in your head why such things happens.

prefrontal cortex goes to sleep and amygdala takes over => reaffirming core beliefs => get caught anxiety

- [ ] How to deal with it?
- [ ] Regulate your emotions, cut through that energy
- [ ] Stop and name the feeling, turn on prefrontal cortex for logical brain
- [ ] Safety lies within you, not in the other person
