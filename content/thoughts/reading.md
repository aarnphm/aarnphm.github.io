A lot of what you [[thoughts/writing|write]] are diffused from what you read. I pretty much spend a lot of my waking hours [[antilibrary|reading]] books (when I'm not working ofc) that I find intellectually interesting and satisfy that itch in the corner of my brain.

This collection of notes aren't necessarily about how I read, because I'm not yet _sure_ how I read. More/less a collection of how people I follow read.

This stream between [Matuschak and Dwarkesh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFuu4pesKf0) on Matuschak's pedagogical process of studying _hard problem_ (in this case quantum mechanics) are pretty good case study of [close reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_reading) that I think resemble a lot of my reading workflow as well.
