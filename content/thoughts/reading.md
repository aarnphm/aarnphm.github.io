A lot of what you [[thoughts/writing|write]] are diffused from what you read. I pretty much spend a lot of my waking hours [[antilibrary|reading]] books (when I'm not working ofc) that is intellectually stimulated and I find interesting. I also do perform [close reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_reading).

I'm not yet _sure_ how I read. But this is more/less a collection of how people I follow read. Inspired by [Zvi's on writing](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/on-writing-1)

## why books don't work

[Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/books/) argues that book lacks a functioning cognitive models so that it left the readers to perform all of these metacognitive tasks, i.e annotations, reflection, essays-writing.

He mentioned the model to be {{sidenotes[_transmissionism_]: according to this [article](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6189484), it is a teacher-centred teaching and learning model in which the teacher's role is to design lessons aimed at predetermined goals and to present knowledge and skills in a predetermined order, and the students' tasks are to **passively** a acquire teacher-specified knowledge and skills}}. verbatim:
