A lot of what you [[thoughts/writing|write]] are diffused from what you read. I pretty much spend a lot of my waking hours [[antilibrary|reading]] books (when I'm not working ofc) that is intellectually stimulated and I find interesting. I also do perform [close reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_reading).

I'm not yet _sure_ how I read. But this is more/less a collection of how people I follow read. Inspired by [Zvi's on writing](https://thezvi.substack.com/p/on-writing-1)
