[@viÃ©gas2023modelusermodelexploring]

How can we manipulate new ideas and abstractions to create new ==notations==?

2. An interface always gives or takes agency. _Be intentional_ about which you choose
3. Represent to communicate, not model.

Engaged use:

- see clearly from right perspectives. Express intent naturally and precisely.
- Explore the possible spaces only through engaging with the information
