> How do we represent [[thoughts/data|information flow]] when we interact with different mediums, esp. text?

Maps shape _==how we see and understand the world==_, which in turn shapes how we act within it.

How can we manipulate new ideas and abstractions to create new ==notations==?

Thesis: Technologies for _representation_ mediate how we see the world.

Tenet:

2. An interface always gives or takes agency. _Be intentional_ about which you choose
3. Represent to communicate, not model.

==Seeing clearly== to exercise _[[thoughts/Agency|agency]]_

## interface

Instrumental use:

Engaged use:

- see clearly from right perspectives. Express intent naturally and precisely.
- Explore the possible spaces only through engaging with the information
