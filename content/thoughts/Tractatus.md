## architectural skeleton

The numbered propositions build like this:

1. **the world and facts**: The world is the totality of facts, not things. Ontology is extensional rather than object-first.

2. **states of affairs**: Facts resolve into states of affairs; names combine in elementary propositions to picture possible configurations.

3. **logical pictures**: A proposition is a logical picture of reality; the shared logical form—not any represented material—grounds sense.

4. **thought and truth-conditions**: Thought, proposition, and reality align through truth-conditions; truth-functions exhaust how sense-bearing propositions are generated.

5. **operations and general form**: Operations on elementary propositions yield the total space of meaningful discourse, culminating in the general form of the proposition.

6. **logic's boundaries**: Logic, mathematics, natural science, and the limits of language are clarified via tautologies, contradictions, and the picture theory boundary between saying and showing.

7. **silence**: Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent—both an instruction and the terminal rung of the ladder.

## truth-functions, notation, and the n-operator

1. **the general form**: Wittgenstein contends that every meaningful proposition can be written as a truth-function of elementary propositions:

   $$
   \bar{p},\bar{\xi},n(\bar{\xi})
   $$

   The single truth-operation $n$ corresponds to the Sheffer stroke; iterating it over a set of atomic propositions reconstructs the full propositional calculus.

2. **quantifiers as operations**: This eliminates quantifiers as primitive, treating them as higher-level truth-operations.

3. **tautologies and contradictions**: Tautologies and contradictions lack sense but show the logical form binding language and world: tautologies display the bounds of logical necessity, while contradictions display impossibility.

   > Later critiques argue that compressing quantification and identity into $n$ leaves explanatory gaps, motivating post-Tractarian reassessments of the general-form programme.

## limits, ethics, and the mystical

1. **the transcendental position**: 6.4–6.522 position ethics, aesthetics, and the meaning of life outside propositional content. [[thoughts/Value]] does not describe states of affairs but transforms the subject's perspective on the world as a whole.

2. **showing at the limit**: Ethical is transcendental here where it shows itself when language reaches its limit. The mystical is the recognition that the world exists, not any fact within it.

3. **methodological silence**: Silence is the methodological boundary: once logic has clarified grammar, ethical insight must be lived rather than said.

## interpretive tensions

1. **metaphysical reading**: Metaphysical readings take the Tractatus at face value: it provides a realist metaphysics of simple objects, logical atomism, and a theory of meaning that we are instructed to accept before climbing down.

2. **resolute reading**: Resolute or austere readings argue that the work is intentionally self-defeating: by the time we reach 6.54, we see that every substantive proposition in the book is nonsense, and the only lasting lesson is a therapeutic method for dissolving philosophical pseudo-problems.

3. **moderate synthesis**: Recent moderate interpretations integrate both: the ladder is therapeutic, yet we learn determinate logical insights (e.g., the role of truth-operations) along the way.

4. **ongoing debates**: Debates now focus on whether the text licenses any positive doctrine about simple objects, whether the mystical passages commit Wittgenstein to ineffable values, and how to square the Tractatus with the later investigations without attributing a total break.

## the Vienna Circle's appropriation (1922–1936)

1. **arrival and formation**
   - 1.1 **initial introduction (1922)**: In 1922, Hans Hahn brought the Tractatus to the University of Vienna, and together with Kurt Reidemeister organized seminars reading Wittgenstein's text alongside Russell and Whitehead's Principia Mathematica.
   - 1.2 **schlick's organization**: When Moritz Schlick arrived at Vienna's chair of philosophy of the inductive sciences (formerly Mach's chair) that same year, he organized what became the Vienna Circle.

     > the Tractatus served as their founding document—Schlick told Einstein it was the "deepest" work of "the new philosophy."

2. **intensive study and misreading**
   - 2.1 **the paragraph-by-paragraph year (1926/27)**: The circle devoted the entire 1926/27 academic year to reading the Tractatus paragraph by paragraph.
   - 2.2 **personal meetings (1927–1932)**: From 1927 on, Wittgenstein met personally with Schlick and Friedrich Waismann, sometimes joined by Rudolf Carnap and Herbert Feigl.

     > These conversations (December 1929–March 1932) were recorded by Waismann and published posthumously as _Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle_ (1979).

   - 2.3 **restricted contact and tensions**: From 1929 onward, Wittgenstein restricted contact to Schlick and Waismann alone.
     - 2.31 > Yet the relationship was fraught. In an early meeting, Wittgenstein turned his back to the circle and read Tagore aloud for over an hour, then left silently.
     - 2.32 > Carnap remarked to Schlick: "I guess he is not one of us." Wittgenstein later complained his views were "more or less mangled or watered down" and told Schlick:
     - 2.33 > "I cannot imagine that Carnap should have so completely misunderstood the last sentences of the book and hence the fundamental conception of the entire book."

3. **key figures and their uptake**
   - 3.1 **moritz schlick (1882–1936)**: Had already published _General Theory of Knowledge_ (1918) before encountering the Tractatus.
   - 3.11 The 1925 second edition incorporated Tractarian influence, linking Wittgenstein's picture theory with Schlick's scientific realism.
   - 3.12 In "Experience, Cognition, and Metaphysics" (1926), Schlick convicted metaphysics for trying to express as logically structured cognition what is merely inexpressible qualitative content—a Tractarian theme.
     - 3.121 Schlick endorsed Wittgenstein's correspondence theory and metalinguistic problem of how language represents reality, defending it against Otto Neurath's coherentism.
   - 3.2 **rudolf carnap (1891–1970)**: Mined the Tractatus for tools to build logical empiricism.
     - 3.21 _Der logische Aufbau der Welt_ (1928)—Carnap's phenomenalist reconstruction of scientific concepts—became, alongside the Tractatus, a classic Vienna Circle text.
     - 3.22 Carnap reinterpreted Wittgenstein's atomic facts as "elementary experiences" (_Elementarerlebnisse_), though where Wittgenstein insisted neither individual nor property was basic,
     - 3.221 Carnap followed Gestalt psychology: holistic experiences were epistemically prior to atomic sensations, grounded in a "recollection-of-similarity" relation.
     - 3.23 **the elimination manifesto (1932)**: In 1932, Carnap published "Überwindung der Metaphysik durch logische Analyse der Sprache" (the elimination of metaphysics through logical analysis of language), weaponizing Tractarian logic against Heidegger and traditional metaphysics.
       - 3.231 Carnap distinguished genuine statements from pseudo-statements (sequences lacking meaning due to meaningless words or invalid syntax), declaring metaphysics riddled with both.
       - 3.232 Yet Carnap's standard of acceptability shifted: not Tractarian meaning (picturing states of affairs) but translatability into the "formal mode of speech."
     - 3.24 **logical syntax breakthrough (1934)**: _Logische Syntax der Sprache_ (1934) marked the breakthrough—January 1931's rejection of Tractarian theory for Hilbert-Gödel-Tarski meta-mathematics. Where the Tractatus forbade speaking about logical form within language, Carnap proved this possible through syntactic meta-language.
     - 3.25 **principle of tolerance**: The principle of tolerance emerged in 1932 during Carnap's protocol sentence debate with Neurath: no language is definitive or "correct"; there is no logical "reality" for language to correspond to. This repudiated the Tractatus's single logical form binding language and world.
       - 3.251 > Carnap later admitted: "Earlier, when reading Wittgenstein's book in the circle, I had erroneously believed his attitude toward metaphysics was similar to ours. I had not paid sufficient attention to the statements about the mystical, because his feelings and thoughts in this area were too divergent from mine."
   - 3.3 **otto neurath (1882–1945)**: Vehemently rejected the picture theory and Wittgenstein's phenomenal elementary propositions.
     - 3.31 Influenced by Mach, Duhem, and Marxism, Neurath explored empirical and historical conditions of scientific practice, opposing Schlick's Wittgensteinian concern with representation.
     - 3.32 Neurath maintained strict rejection of all objectivism claiming science yields isomorphic pictures of the world.
       - 3.321 In the protocol sentence debates (1931–1934), Neurath introduced physicalism—requiring protocols be translatable to physics language—against Tractarian phenomenalism.
     - 3.322 Wittgenstein accused Carnap of plagiarism over physicalism in 1932.
   - 3.4 **friedrich waismann (1896–1959)**: Was Wittgenstein's most faithful interpreter, accepted as discussion partner from 1927 and tasked by Schlick with writing an exposition of Wittgenstein's philosophy.
     - 3.41 Waismann's "theses" (circa 1930) elaborated the orthodox circle position, defining logical positivism's hallmark: "If there is no way of telling when a proposition is true, then the proposition has no sense whatever; for the sense of a proposition is its method of verification."
     - 3.42 This verification principle, discussed by Wittgenstein with Schlick and Waismann on 22 December 1929 and 2 January 1930, became central to logical positivism—though Wittgenstein intended it constitutively while the circle wielded it as demarcation criterion against metaphysics.
     - 3.43 Waismann complained collaborative work with Wittgenstein was difficult:
       > "He was always following inspiration of the moment and demolishing what he had previously sketched out."

4. **concepts borrowed and transformed**
   - 4.1 **verification principle**: The principle articulated by Waismann became logical positivism's criterion of meaning. A.J. Ayer's _Language, Truth and Logic_ (1936)—introducing Vienna Circle ideas to anglophone audiences after Ayer's 1933 Vienna visit—formulated verificationism: an utterance is meaningful only if it expresses a proposition verifiable (in principle) through experience.
   - 4.2 **elimination vs. silence on metaphysics**: The Tractatus's proposition 6.54 instructs readers to recognize its propositions as nonsensical, "throw away the ladder," and pass over in silence what cannot be spoken (7). Wittgenstein considered ethics, aesthetics, and the mystical transcendental—unsayable but supremely important, shown rather than said.
     - 4.21 The circle inverted this: they tossed metaphysics and ethics into the bin as meaningless pseudo-problems. Carnap titled his manifesto "elimination" (_Überwindung_), not "silence."
     - 4.22 Wittgenstein preserved ineffable metaphysics concerning essentials of world-representation; the circle eliminated metaphysics as cognitive garbage.
   - 4.3 **truth-functional analysis**: The Tractatus's demonstration that all propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions, expressible via the n-operator $\bar{p},\bar{\xi},n(\bar{\xi})$, grounded the circle's extensional logic.
     - 4.31 The circle extended this to mathematics (logicism), treating logical truths as tautologies—Wittgenstein's characterization of logic as pure artifact of representation, empty of empirical significance.
     - 4.32 This gave empiricists what they needed: a priori knowledge (logic, mathematics) without rationalist commitments.
   - 4.4 **analytic/synthetic distinction**: The Tractatus's tautologies (showing logical form, saying nothing about the world) underwrote the circle's analytic truths (true by meaning alone, independent of facts) versus synthetic truths (grounded in facts).
     - 4.41 Quine's "two dogmas of empiricism" (1951) attacked this distinction as "an unempirical dogma of empiricists, a metaphysical article of faith," undermining a pillar of Vienna Circle philosophy.
   - 4.5 **protocol sentences and elementary propositions**: The Tractatus's elementary propositions—arrangements of names representing possible arrangements of simple objects—inspired the circle's search for epistemological foundations.
     - 4.51 Carnap's early protocols described observer experiences (1931), later shifting to linguistic question (1934) under Neurath's criticism. Ramsey objected this foundationalism constructed the world from elementary particulars and logic, yielding unacceptable solipsism. Wittgenstein himself later acknowledged his Tractatus notion was wrong: he wasn't clear about logical analysis's sense and thought it revealed what was hidden.
   - 4.6 **logical form and logical syntax**: The Tractatus posited a single shared logical form enabling language to picture reality. Carnap's _Logical Syntax of Language_ (1934) appropriated this as template but pluralized it: Carnap's tolerance principle allowed multiple logical syntaxes, none privileged.
     - 4.61 Eric Loomis (2005) argues Carnap's position is closer to the Tractatus than recognized—Carnap didn't reject Tractarian insights but translated them into meta-mathematical framework, speaking formally about what Wittgenstein said must be shown.

5. **divergences and frustrations**
   - 5.1 **simple objects**: The Tractatus's logically simple objects remained unspecified, prompting debate (ontological: universals or particulars? [[thoughts/Epistemology|epistemological]]: how knowable?). The circle attempted construction. Carnap's Aufbau tried elementary experiences.
     - 5.11 But TLP 6.54 suggests simple objects belong to the ladder—nonsensical scaffolding to be discarded. Many now think questions about simple objects' nature miss the therapeutic point.
   - 5.2 **saying vs. showing**: The circle concentrated on anti-metaphysical implications for the sayable, knowing they received mysticism "in the bargain" (Neurath's critical note). Wittgenstein's core distinction—logical form shows itself, cannot be said; ethics and aesthetics lie outside the sayable—was precisely what the circle most misunderstood.
     - 5.21 They treated TLP 6.4–7 (ethics, God, death, the mystical) as confused, with Carnap encouraging readers to ignore concluding sentences.
     - 5.22 Yet Wittgenstein held these passages contained the book's fundamental conception.
   - 5.3 **ramsey's pragmatist critique**: Frank Ramsey—translator of the Tractatus, visitor to Vienna (summer 1924), introduced to Schlick and Hahn—posed pragmatist objections that targeted both Wittgenstein and the circle.
     - 5.31 Ramsey prevailed over Wittgenstein (who acknowledged help realizing Tractatus mistakes), but the circle remained unaware; Ramsey died in 1930 before engaging them directly.
     - 5.32 The 1929 Vienna Circle manifesto listed Ramsey among those "sympathetic," though he and Carnap never met.

6. **legacy and reassessment**
   - 6.1 **the "two Wittgensteins" problem**: The circle faced what became a perennial issue: early Wittgenstein (Tractatus: fixed logical structure, pictorial meaning, logical atomism) versus late Wittgenstein (Investigations: meaning as use, language games, therapeutic philosophy). Standard interpretations see a radical break.
     - 6.11 The circle read the Tractatus as realist metaphysics to accept before climbing down (metaphysical reading).
     - 6.12 Later resolute readers (Cora Diamond, James Conant) argue the work is self-defeating: by 6.54, all propositions are nonsensical; the lesson is therapeutic method dissolving pseudo-problems (austere reading).
     - 6.13 Peter Hacker critiques the "new Wittgensteinians," arguing Wittgenstein's propositions are "important nonsense"—they say nothing but show something vital about language and world.
     - 6.14 The circle's foundationalist empiricism exemplifies the metaphysical reading the Tractatus may have aimed to dissolve.
   - 6.2 **recent scholarship (2000s–2020s)**: Thomas Uebel's work (2005, 2007, 2010, 2020) recovers neglected diversity within the circle—no homogeneous group, but contested positions.
     - 6.21 Uebel's _Empiricism at the Crossroads: The Vienna Circle's Protocol-Sentence Debate_ (2007) reinterprets key disputes.
     - 6.22 Michael Friedman's _Reconsidering Logical Positivism_ (1999) argues the circle's radicalism wasn't new empiricism but new conception of a priori knowledge and its role in empirical knowledge, examining Carnap's debt to Kant, not just Wittgenstein.
     - 6.23 Warren Goldfarb and Burton Dreben's Harvard lectures (1970s–1990s) on Wittgenstein, Frege, Carnap, and Quine questioned traditional readings, influencing a generation of scholars.
     - 6.24 The "left Vienna Circle" research (Don Howard, Alan Richardson, George Reisch, Thomas Uebel) explores socio-political dimensions long forgotten: Neurath's Marxism, unity of science movement's progressive aspirations, philosophy of science as political philosophy. The circle wasn't just formal logicians but engaged intellectuals navigating interwar Vienna's crises.
   - 6.3 **logical tolerance and grammatical arbitrariness**: Recent work re-reads Carnap's tolerance not as betrayal of the Tractatus but as radicalizing it.
     - 6.31 If the Tractatus shows logical form but cannot say it, Carnap's pluralism acknowledges no metaphysical fact determines the "correct" logic.
     - 6.32 Yet Tractarian pictures constrained how far expedient syntaxes could drift from representing reality. The negotiation between Tractarian constraint and Carnapian freedom remains contested.
   - 6.4 **the Tractatus's template for logical syntax**: Carnap's debt to Wittgenstein is deeper than elimination of metaphysics.
     - 6.41 The Tractatus demonstrated how to analyze language's logical structure, distinguish sense from nonsense, and clarify philosophical pseudo-problems through logic.
     - 6.42 Carnap operationalized this program, even as he departed from Wittgenstein's single fixed form.
     - 6.43 The Tractatus supplied not just conclusions but a method—logical analysis of language as philosophy's proper task—that defined analytic philosophy for decades.
   - 6.5 **wittgenstein's retrospective distance**: By the 1930s, Wittgenstein was critiquing the Tractatus's picture theory, simple objects, and [[#logical space and embedding space|logical]] atomism.
     - 6.51 His Cambridge lectures (1930s onward) dismantled the earlier project.
     - 6.52 But the circle's version—hardened into logical positivism's verificationism, protocol sentences, and physicalism—persisted until Quine's "two dogmas" (1951) shattered analytic/synthetic distinction and reductionism.
     - 6.53 Even then, the Tractatus's influence endured: _Philosophical Investigations_ (1953) begins "In the _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_..." The ladder wasn't merely discarded; it structured the terrain traversed.

## the picture theory

1. **propositions as pictures**: Propositions are pictures of reality. They represent possible states of affairs by sharing **logical form** with facts—language and world have isomorphic structure.
2. **structural correspondence**: Just as a picture contains elements in spatial relation, a proposition contains names in logical relation. The proposition shows its sense (how things stand if true) but cannot say what that sense is.
3. **projective relationship**: Picture theory construes propositions as models with a projective relationship to the world: names correspond to simple objects, syntactic concatenation mirrors possible combinations, and logical form is the invariant structure enabling projection.
4. **state and non-state**: The proposition itself, a significant sentence, asserts this possibility, dividing reality into what "is the case" (positive facts) and what "is not the case" (negative facts).
   - 4.1 Both true and false propositions have **sense** (Sinn)—they both picture possibilities in logical space. If the state of affairs obtains, the proposition is true; if not, false. But both are meaningful because they depict genuine possibilities.

## logical space and embedding space

1. **defining logical space**: Wittgenstein defined **logical space** as the totality of all possible states of affairs. Every proposition carves out a region—the possibilities it allows and those it excludes.
2. **mapping to neural architectures**: This maps onto embedding spaces in neural networks with surprising precision:

   | Tractatus concept           | [[thoughts/LLMs\|LLM]] latent space  |
   | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
   | logical space               | high-dimensional embedding space     |
   | elementary propositions     | atomic token embeddings              |
   | states of affairs           | activation patterns / vectors        |
   | logical form                | relational structure in vector space |
   | truth-functional operations | tensor operations in layers          |
   | showing vs. saying          | implicit vs. explicit representation |

3. **structural isomorphism**: Emerging research (2024-25) explores whether this is **structural isomorphism** rather than mere metaphor [@russin2024frege;@hong2024transformers]. Tokens acquire semantic coherence not by direct reference but by their relational position within the grammar-defined latent space. This precisely mirrors Wittgenstein's insight: propositions acquire meaning through rule-governed relations within logical spaces.

## the negation problem

1. **negation as formal operation**: Wittgenstein recognized negation as a **formal operation**, not content addition (TLP 4.0621). The proposition p and its negation ¬p have opposite truth-poles but the same sense—they picture the same state of affairs with reversed polarity.
2. **no negative facts**: Negation doesn't create a separate "negative fact" in the world. There are only facts; negation is a feature of propositional representation.
3. **LLM and negation**
   - 3.1 **the struggle with negation**: LLMs notoriously struggle with negation—a deep vindication of Wittgenstein's analysis [@ettinger2020bert;@kassner2020negated]:
     - models trained predominantly on affirmative sentences
     - negation tokens have limited effect on learned representations [@kassner2020negated]
     - distributional semantics captures word co-occurrence (what is **said**) but misses logical structure (what is **shown**)
   - 3.2 **attempted solutions**: Solutions like logical neural networks (LNNs) encode negation algebraically $(\neq x = 1 - x)$, treating it as structural transformation rather than learned pattern. The problem remains largely unsolved—echoing Wittgenstein's insight that negation is structural, not lexical.

## showing vs. saying

1. **the fundamental distinction**: TLP 4.1212: "What can be shown cannot be said"
   - logical form **shows itself** in propositions but **cannot be said**
   - you cannot step outside language to describe its relation to reality
   - ethics, aesthetics, the mystical lie outside the sayable—they show themselves but resist propositional formulation
2. **[[thoughts/mechanistic interpretability]]**
   - 2.1 **implicit vs. explicit knowledge**: LLMs **show** linguistic competence through performance but cannot **say** their own rules:
     - grammatical rules, semantic relations, world knowledge encoded in parameters and activations (implicit)
     - generated text follows those rules without stating them (explicit)
     - attempts to make LLMs explain their reasoning often produce confabulation
   - 2.2 **the impossibility of self-explanation**: Cf [[thoughts/representations]]: Expecting LLMs to explain themselves violates the Tractatus.

## possibility vs. actuality

1. **wittgenstein's framework**:
   - 1.1 logical space = all possible combinations of objects
   - 1.2 the world = the subset that actually obtains (facts)
   - 1.3 propositions specify **possibility**, truth/falsity determine **actuality**

2. **LLM parallel**:
   - 2.1 embedding space = continuous possibility space
   - 2.2 training data = sampled actualities
   - 2.3 model assigns probabilities to regions of latent space
   - 2.4 decoding = sampling from possibility space conditioned on context

3. **probabilistic logical space**: LLMs operate in a **probabilistic logical space**. They represent not just what is the case, but what could be the case with what likelihood.
   - 3.1 Key difference: Tractatus assumes sharp boundary between possible (senseful) and impossible (nonsense). LLMs have soft boundaries—everything has some probability, even nonsense.

## [[thoughts/ethics]] and the unsayable

1. **transcendental ethics**: TLP 6.421: "ethics is transcendental"
2. **moral language without moral understanding**: [moralchoice](https://github.com/ninodimontalcino/moralchoice) evaluates LLMs on moral scenarios, finding models choose "commonsense" answers in clear cases but express uncertainty in ambiguous ones. but is this understanding or pattern-matching?
   - 2.1 LLMs learn to talk _about_ values without genuine moral understanding. They say moral sentences without showing moral understanding. Values involve forms of life, not just language patterns.
3. **the alignment problem**: Technical alignment (RLHF, constitutional AI) won't capture ethics fully—it attempts to **say** what can only be **shown**.

## open questions

1. **formal detection**: can tautologies and contradictions be detected in latent space?
2. **logical operations in attention**: do certain attention patterns correspond to logical operations (conjunction, disjunction, implication)? [@zheng2025enhancing]
3. **atomic facts and neural representations**: is there formal mapping from atomic facts to neural representations, or is it compositional all the way down?
4. **representing impossibility**: how do LLMs represent impossible states—low probability, zero probability, undefined regions? [@helliwell2024wittgenstein]
5. **multimodal grounding**: does multimodal grounding (vision-language models) implement pictorial representation more directly?
