[Jacky's post](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/aesthetics-and-taste)

> We have built up an instinctive habit of looking things up and seeing how other people have done it before trying it for ourselves. But the downside is that this habit primes our brains to value our work in the context of the taste of others rather than of our own. We have outsourced our [[thoughts/Value|value]] systems for what is good and bad (how we may judge [[thoughts/aesthetic value|aesthetic value]]) to other people.

> Looking at the history of scientific progress, we see plenty of evidence on how this reliance on the taste of committees and society broadly only serves to inhibit progress. Managed creativity can, at best, produce only what its managers specify. All that remains are the ideas that live in the Overton Window
