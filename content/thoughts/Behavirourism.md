Positive reinforcement (praise, rewards) strengthens the behaviour and increases the likelihood of it being repeated, where as negative reinforcement ensures such behaviour are not being repeated.

Observable behavior is all that matters. Mind is a black box; if you can't measure it, don't theorize about it. Positive reinforcement (praise, rewards) strengthens the behaviour and increases the likelihood of it being repeated. Negative reinforcement ensures such behaviour are not repeated. Stimulus → response. Environment shapes everything.

This works for training pigeons. For understanding persons? Catastrophically incomplete.

## framework

Behaviorism treats organisms as input-output systems. Internal states—beliefs, desires, attention, understanding—are either eliminable or reducible to behavioral dispositions. If you want to explain why someone does X, point to reinforcement history, not mental states. [@skinner1953sciencehumanbehavior]

> stay with observables, avoid introspection, build prediction models from stimulus-response patterns, i.e: _functionalist appeal without [[thoughts/functionalism|functionalist]] commitments_. (functionalism _posits_ internal states defined by causal role; behaviorism _eliminates_ them.)

## what it misses

### attention is not a behavior

> Simone Weil: attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity. [@weil1952gravity]

Behaviorism can't touch this. [[thoughts/Attention]] is not an observable response; it's the _quality_ of your engagement, the structure of what you're oriented toward.
You can behaviorally comply (make eye contact, nod, repeat back) while completely absent. Attention resists third-person measurement.

> Iris Murdoch: moral life happens in ongoing attention—how you _think_ about someone, what you notice, what possibilities you hold open for them. [@murdoch1970sovereignty]

None of this shows up in behavior until much later, if at all. The decision is already made before you act, made through accumulated patterns of attention.

Behaviorism collapses attention into behavioral output. But attention _precedes_ behavior. You can't reinforce attention; you can only reinforce behavioral proxies. The gap is everything.

### love is not conditioned response

If behaviorism is right, [[/tags/love]] is just positive reinforcement. You "love" someone because they've consistently rewarded you: dopamine, validation, security. Withdraw the reinforcement, love extinguishes. Add punishment, love turns to avoidance.

This predicts abusive relationships should end quickly (high punishment). They don't. It predicts secure relationships are just well-tuned reinforcement schedules. They're not—people stay through illness, depression, long separation, all conditions that break behavioral contingencies.

> [!note] [[thoughts/Existentialism|existentialist]] choice
>
> love is _choice_. You commit to someone not because they reinforce you but because you _decide_ to make them central. [@kierkegaard1847worksoflove; @fromm1956art; @hooks2000love]

Kierkegaard: love is duty. Not duty imposed from outside, but duty you _give yourself_. "You shall love" makes love free--it's independent of the object's behavior. They can change, fail, disappoint; you chose this, you remain. [@kierkegaard1847worksoflove]

Fromm: love is art, requiring discipline and practice. [@fromm1956art] Not a feeling that happens to you (behaviorist model: stimulus triggers affective response) but an activity you perform. The activity is voluntary. You choose to attend, to understand, to care—regardless of whether it's immediately reinforcing.

bell hooks: love is action. [@hooks2000love] When you understand love as action, you assume accountability. You can't say "I couldn't help it" (behaviorist excuse: the environment controlled me). You chose. You're responsible.

[[thoughts/Camus]]: The misery and greatness of this world: it offers no truths, but only objects for love. Absurdity is king, but love saves us from it.

### the [[thoughts/Compression|compression]] problem

Behaviorism tries to compress persons to stimulus-response mappings. Collect enough data, predict their behavior. This is the [[thoughts/Compression|compression]] problem: lossy compression discards what doesn't predict.

What gets discarded: first-person experience, attention, intention, the _reasons_ they act. You model the function (input → output) but miss the process (how they make sense of the input, what it means to them, what they're trying to do).

This works when you don't care about the person—only their behavior. Advertising, management, behavioral modification. It breaks when you need to _understand_ them. Understanding requires entering their horizon (see [[thoughts/hermeneutics]]), not compressing them to a model.

> [!important]

> You can't love someone you've [[thoughts/reductionism|reduced]] to a function. [[/posts/love|Love]] requires attending to what resists compression: their irreducibility, their first-person givenness, their capacity to surprise you.

## determinism and freedom

Behaviorism is deterministic: behavior is fully determined by reinforcement history plus current stimulus. No internal freedom, no voluntary choice, no "self" that could decide otherwise.

Existentialist response: even if causally influenced, you're _responsible_. You can't hide behind your conditioning. Sartre: you're "condemned to be free"—even when you claim "I had no choice," you chose to see it that way. [@sartre1943being]

This isn't libertarian free will (uncaused choice from nowhere). It's _situated_ freedom: you're shaped by history, but you still decide how to respond. The same reinforcement schedule produces different people because people aren't passive recipients—they interpret, resist, reframe.

Choosing to love someone is choosing _despite_ the absence of guarantees. No reinforcement schedule can make you do that. You do it because you decided it matters.

## what i think behaviorism gets right

Behaviorism is correct that: environment shapes us, reinforcement patterns matter, much behavior is unconscious/automatic, introspection is unreliable, observable criteria beat subjective reports.

It's correct as _constraint_ on theorizing: if your model of mind doesn't predict behavior, it's incomplete. Functionalism absorbs this (see [[thoughts/functionalism]]—causal role must match behavioral profile). But functionalism adds: internal states matter _when they make causal difference_. Attention, intention, understanding—these aren't epiphenomenal. They're part of the functional story.

Behaviorism's mistake is that it treats methodological restriction (study observables) as metaphysical claim (only observables exist). You can be methodologically behavioral without being ontologically behaviorist.

## [[thoughts/Wittgenstein|wittgensteinian]] intervention

> what are the _criteria_ for saying someone loves another, attends to them, understands them?

Criteria are behavioral—but not reducible to reflex. You can tell someone loves another by: how they talk about them, what they notice, how they respond under stress, whether they stay when it's hard, whether their attention tracks the other's concerns.

These are observable. But they're not stimulus-response. They're _patterns of engagement_ that make sense only within a practice, a form of life. Love is a language-game. You learn it by participating, not by collecting reinforcement data.

Behaviorism mistakes criteria (public, behavioral) for reduction (nothing but behavior). From Wittgenstein that we learn criteria shows what's going on without ==being== what's going on. One can use behavior to recognize love, but love isn't identical to behavior.

## tl;dr

Behaviorism treats people as input-output devices. This eliminates attention (quality of engagement), love (voluntary commitment), understanding (first-person sense-making). You can condition behavior; you can't condition choice. Love resists reinforcement theory—it's choosing to stay in relationship regardless of behavioral contingencies. Compression problem: models predict behavior but miss what makes someone a person. Use behaviorism for training, not understanding. For love, see [[thoughts/hermeneutics]].

### critique

- one-dimensional to understand human-behaviour, as it focuses only on observable behaviours and neglects internal mental processes
- deterministic, as it assumes that behaviour is determined by the environment and not by the individual, which induces [[thoughts/confirmation bias]]
- [[thoughts/Compression]] problems: reduces persons to predictive models, discarding first-person experience and irreducible particularity
- cannot account for voluntary commitment (love, duty, choice) that persists through extinction conditions
- mistakes methodological restriction (study observables) for ontological claim (only observables exist)
- eliminates attention as constitutive of moral life and understanding
