I like how his notebooks records fragmented snapshots of his ideas: "the limits of my language mean the limits of my world".

He also posthumously suggested that one "understands" his work by recognizing the "insanity" of language itself and the limitations of what can be said, ultimately leading to a state where one can "pass over in silence" what cannot be clearly spoken.
