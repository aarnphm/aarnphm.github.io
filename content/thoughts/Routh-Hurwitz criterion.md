> Condition for the stability of linear time-invariant (LTI) [[tags/sfwr3dx4|control system]]

> [!important] sufficient condition for Stability
> All coefficients in the first column complete Routh array are the same sign

For a system with transfer function $\hat{G}(s) =  \frac{\mathcal{N}(s)}{\mathcal{D}(s)}$

Input-output stability implies that all root of $\mathcal{d}(s)$ are in the Left Half Plane (LHP)
