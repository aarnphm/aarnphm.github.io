In microeconomics, **economies of scale** are the cost advantages that enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation, typically measured by the amount of output produced per unit of cost (production cost). A decrease in cost per unit of output enables an increase in scale—that is, increased production with lowered cost.

## Overview

The simple meaning of economies of scale is doing things more efficiently with increasing size. Common sources include:

- **Purchasing** (bulk buying through long-term contracts)
- **Managerial** (increasing specialization of managers)
- **Financial** (obtaining lower-interest charges and access to greater range of financial instruments)
- **Marketing** (spreading advertising costs over greater output range)
- **Technological** (taking advantage of returns to scale in the production function)

Each factor reduces the long run average costs (LRAC) by shifting the short-run average total cost (SRATC) curve down and to the right.

Economies of scale exist whenever the total cost of producing two quantities of product X is lower when a single firm instead of two separate firms produce it:

$$TC((Q_1+Q_2)X) < TC(Q_1X) + TC(Q_2X)$$

## Determinants of Economies of Scale

### Physical and Engineering Basis: Economies of Increased Dimension

Some economies have a physical basis, such as the **square–cube law**, by which the surface of a vessel increases by the square of the dimensions while the volume increases by the cube. This law directly affects capital costs of buildings, factories, pipelines, ships and airplanes.

In structural engineering, the strength of beams increases with the cube of the thickness. Drag loss of vehicles generally increases less than proportional with increasing cargo volume, resulting in less fuel consumption per ton of cargo at a given speed.

### Economies in Holding Stocks and Reserves

The greater the number of resources involved, the smaller, in proportion, is the quantity of reserves necessary to cope with unforeseen contingencies (machine spare parts, inventories, circulating capital, etc.).

### Transaction Economies

A larger scale generally determines greater bargaining power over input prices and therefore benefits from pecuniary economies in purchasing raw materials and intermediate goods. Supply contracts entail fixed costs which lead to decreasing average costs if the scale of production increases.

### Economies Deriving from the Balancing of Production Capacity

Economies of productive capacity balancing derive from more efficient use of production capacities in individual phases of the production process. If inputs are indivisible and complementary, small scale may be subject to idle times or underutilization of productive capacity.

### Economies from Division of Labour and Superior Techniques

A larger scale allows for more efficient division of labour. The economies derive from increased production speed, possibility of using specialized personnel, and adopting more efficient techniques.

### Managerial Economics

Many administrative and organizational activities are largely independent of production scale. When company size and division of labour increase, there are advantages from more effective organizational management and perfected accounting and control techniques.

### Learning and Growth Economies

Learning and growth economies are at the base of dynamic economies of scale. Learning by doing implies improvements in ability to perform and promotes introduction of incremental innovations with progressive lowering of average costs. Learning economies are directly proportional to cumulative production (experience curve).

### Capital and Operating Cost

Overall costs of capital projects are subject to economies of scale. A crude estimate is that if the capital cost for a given sized piece of equipment is known, changing the size will change the capital cost by the 0.6 power of the capacity ratio (the **point six to the power rule**).

### Crew Size and Other Operating Costs

Operating crew size for ships, airplanes, trains, etc., does not increase in direct proportion to capacity. Many manufacturing facilities have labor requirements that are not greatly influenced by changes in plant capacity.

### Economical Use of Byproducts

Karl Marx noted that large scale manufacturing allowed economical use of products that would otherwise be waste. The chemical industry remains highly dependent on turning various residual reactant streams into salable products.

## Economies of Scale and Returns to Scale

Economies of scale is related to but can be confused with the theoretical economic notion of **returns to scale**. Where economies of scale refer to a firm's costs, returns to scale describe the relationship between inputs and outputs in a long-run production function.

A production function has:

- **Constant** returns to scale if increasing all inputs by some proportion results in output increasing by that same proportion
- **Decreasing** returns if doubling inputs results in less than double the output
- **Increasing** returns if more than double the output

If the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets, then at a particular output level:

- The firm has economies of scale ⟺ it has increasing returns to scale
- The firm has diseconomies of scale ⟺ it has decreasing returns to scale
- The firm has neither economies nor diseconomies ⟺ it has constant returns to scale

## External Economies of Scale

External economies of scale tend to be more prevalent than internal economies. Through external economies, entry of new firms benefits all existing competitors as it creates greater competition and reduces average cost for all firms.

Advantages include:

- Expansion of the industry
- Benefits most or all firms within the industry
- Can lead to rapid growth of local governments

## Sources

### Purchasing

Firms lower average costs by buying inputs required for production in bulk or from special wholesalers.

### Managerial

Firms might lower average costs by improving management structure within the firm, ranging from hiring better skilled or more experienced managers.

### Technological

Technological advancements change production processes and subsequently reduce overall cost per unit. The rollout of the internet "has completely reshaped the assumptions underlying economies of scale."
